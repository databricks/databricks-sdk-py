If Databricks acquires at least 85% of the requested on-demand nodes, cluster creation will succeed. Otherwise the cluster will terminate with an informative error message.

The destination of driver logs is `$destination/$clusterId/driver`, while the destination   of executor logs is `$destination/$clusterId/executor`. :param cluster_name: str (optional)   Cluster name requested by the user.

This field, along with node_type_id, should not be set if virtual_cluster_size is set.

A cluster has one Spark Driver and   `num_workers` Executors for a total of `num_workers` + 1 Spark nodes.    Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number of workers   rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster is resized from 5 to 10   workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect the target size of 10 workers, whereas   the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are   provisioned. :param policy_id: str (optional)   The ID of the cluster policy used to create the cluster if applicable. :param remote_disk_throughput: int (optional)   If set, what the configurable throughput (in Mb/s) for the remote disk is.

Please   note that key-value pair of the form (X,Y) will be exported as is (i.e., `export X='Y'`) while   launching the driver and workers.    In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending them to   `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all default databricks   managed environmental variables are included as well.    Example Spark environment variables: `{""SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY"": ""28000m"", ""SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS"":   ""/local_disk0""}` or `{""SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS"": ""$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS   -Dspark.shuffle.service.enabled=true""}` :param ssh_public_keys: List[str] (optional)   SSH public key contents that will be added to each Spark node in this cluster.

This validation uses AWS dry-run mode for the RunInstances API. If validation   fails with an error message that does not indicate an IAM related permission issue, (e.g. “Your   requested instance type is not supported in your requested availability zone”), you can pass this   flag to skip the validation and forcibly add the instance profile.",instance_profiles,add,insert,
