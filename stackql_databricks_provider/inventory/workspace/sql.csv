The main differences from using `INLINE` disposition are that the result data is accessed with URLs, and that there are 3 supported formats: `JSON_ARRAY`, `ARROW_STREAM` and `CSV` compared to only `JSON_ARRAY` with `INLINE`.  ** URLs**  External links point to data stored within your workspace's internal storage, in the form of a URL. The URLs are valid for only a short period, <= 15 minutes. Alongside each `external_link` is an expiration field indicating the time at which the URL is no longer valid. In `EXTERNAL_LINKS` mode, chunks can be resolved and fetched multiple times and in parallel.  ----  ### **Warning: Databricks strongly recommends that you protect the URLs that are returned by the `EXTERNAL_LINKS` disposition.**  When you use the `EXTERNAL_LINKS` disposition, a short-lived, URL is generated, which can be used to download the results directly from . As a short-lived is embedded in this URL, you should protect the URL.  Because URLs are already generated with embedded temporary s, you must not set an `Authorization` header in the download requests.  The `EXTERNAL_LINKS` disposition can be disabled upon request by creating a support case.  See also [Security best practices].  ----  StatementResponse contains `statement_id` and `status`; other fields might be absent or present depending on context. If the SQL warehouse fails to execute the provided statement, a 200 response is returned with `status.state` set to `FAILED` (in contrast to a failure when accepting the request, which results in a non-200 response). Details of the error can be found at `status.error` in case of execution failures.  [Security best practices]: https://docs.databricks.com/sql/admin/sql-execution-tutorial.html#security-best-practices  :param statement: str   The SQL statement to execute. The statement can optionally be parameterized, see `parameters`. The   maximum query text size is 16 MiB. :param warehouse_id: str   Warehouse upon which to execute a statement. See also [What are SQL warehouses?]    [What are SQL warehouses?]: https://docs.databricks.com/sql/admin/warehouse-type.html :param byte_limit: int (optional)   Applies the given byte limit to the statement's result size. Byte counts are based on internal data   representations and might not match the final size in the requested `format`. If the result was   truncated due to the byte limit, then `truncated` in the response is set to `true`. When using   `EXTERNAL_LINKS` disposition, a default `byte_limit` of 100 GiB is applied if `byte_limit` is not   explicitly set. :param catalog: str (optional)   Sets default catalog for statement execution, similar to [`USE CATALOG`] in SQL.    [`USE CATALOG`]: https://docs.databricks.com/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-use-catalog.html :param disposition: :class:`Disposition` (optional)   The fetch disposition provides two modes of fetching results: `INLINE` and `EXTERNAL_LINKS`.    Statements executed with `INLINE` disposition will return result data inline, in `JSON_ARRAY`   format, in a series of chunks. If a given statement produces a result set with a size larger than 25   MiB, that statement execution is aborted, and no result set will be available.    **NOTE** Byte limits are computed based upon internal representations of the result set data, and   might not match the sizes visible in JSON responses.    Statements executed with `EXTERNAL_LINKS` disposition will return result data as external links:   URLs that point to cloud storage internal to the workspace. Using `EXTERNAL_LINKS` disposition   allows statements to generate arbitrarily sized result sets for fetching up to 100 GiB. The   resulting links have two important properties:    1. They point to resources _external_ to the Databricks compute; therefore any associated   authentication information (typically a personal access token, OAuth token, or similar) _must be   removed_ when fetching from these links.    2. These are URLs with a specific expiration, indicated in the response. The behavior when   attempting to use an expired link is cloud specific. :param format: :class:`Format` (optional)   Statement execution supports three result formats: `JSON_ARRAY` (default), `ARROW_STREAM`, and   `CSV`.    Important: The formats `ARROW_STREAM` and `CSV` are supported only with `EXTERNAL_LINKS`   disposition. `JSON_ARRAY` is supported in `INLINE` and `EXTERNAL_LINKS` disposition.    When specifying `format=JSON_ARRAY`, result data will be formatted as an array of arrays of values,   where each value is either the *string representation* of a value, or `null`. For example, the   output of `SELECT concat('id-', id) AS strCol, id AS intCol, null AS nullCol FROM range(3)` would   look like this:    ``` [ [ ""id-1"", ""1"", null ], [ ""id-2"", ""2"", null ], [ ""id-3"", ""3"", null ], ] ```    When specifying `format=JSON_ARRAY` and `disposition=EXTERNAL_LINKS`, each chunk in the result   contains compact JSON with no indentation or extra whitespace.    When specifying `format=ARROW_STREAM` and `disposition=EXTERNAL_LINKS`, each chunk in the result   will be formatted as Apache Arrow Stream. See the [Apache Arrow streaming format].    When specifying `format=CSV` and `disposition=EXTERNAL_LINKS`, each chunk in the result will be a   CSV according to [RFC 4180] standard. All the columns values will have *string representation*   similar to the `JSON_ARRAY` format, and `null` values will be encoded as “null”. Only the first   chunk in the result would contain a header row with column names. For example, the output of `SELECT   concat('id-', id) AS strCol, id AS intCol, null as nullCol FROM range(3)` would look like this:    ``` strCol,intCol,nullCol id-1,1,null id-2,2,null id-3,3,null ```    [Apache Arrow streaming format]: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#ipc-streaming-format   [RFC 4180]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180 :param on_wait_timeout: :class:`ExecuteStatementRequestOnWaitTimeout` (optional)   When `wait_timeout > 0s`, the call will block up to the specified time. If the statement execution   doesn't finish within this time, `on_wait_timeout` determines whether the execution should continue   or be canceled. When set to `CONTINUE`, the statement execution continues asynchronously and the   call returns a statement ID which can be used for polling with   :method:statementexecution/getStatement. When set to `CANCEL`, the statement execution is canceled   and the call returns with a `CANCELED` state. :param parameters: List[:class:`StatementParameterListItem`] (optional)   A list of parameters to pass into a SQL statement containing parameter markers. A parameter consists   of a name, a value, and optionally a type. To represent a NULL value, the `value` field may be   omitted or set to `null` explicitly. If the `type` field is omitted, the value is interpreted as a   string.    If the type is given, parameters will be checked for type correctness according to the given type. A   value is correct if the provided string can be converted to the requested type using the `cast`   function. The exact semantics are described in the section [`cast` function] of the SQL language   reference.    For example, the following statement contains two parameters, `my_name` and `my_date`:    ``` SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = :my_name AND date = :my_date ```    The parameters can be passed in the request body as follows:    ` { ..., ""statement"": ""SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = :my_name AND date = :my_date"",   ""parameters"": [ { ""name"": ""my_name"", ""value"": ""the name"" }, { ""name"": ""my_date"", ""value"":   ""2020-01-01"", ""type"": ""DATE"" } ] } `    Currently, positional parameters denoted by a `?` marker are not supported by the Databricks SQL   Statement Execution API.    Also see the section [Parameter markers] of the SQL language reference.    [Parameter markers]: https://docs.databricks.com/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-parameter-marker.html   [`cast` function]: https://docs.databricks.com/sql/language-manual/functions/cast.html :param query_tags: List[:class:`QueryTag`] (optional)   An array of query tags to annotate a SQL statement. A query tag consists of a non-empty key and,   optionally, a value. To represent a NULL value, either omit the `value` field or manually set it to   `null` or white space. Refer to the SQL language reference for the format specification of query   tags. There's no significance to the order of tags. Only one value per key will be recorded. A   sequence in excess of 20 query tags will be coerced to 20. Example:    { ..., ""query_tags"": [ { ""key"": ""team"", ""value"": ""eng"" }, { ""key"": ""some key only tag"" } ] } :param row_limit: int (optional)   Applies the given row limit to the statement's result set, but unlike the `LIMIT` clause in SQL, it   also sets the `truncated` field in the response to indicate whether the result was trimmed due to   the limit or not. :param schema: str (optional)   Sets default schema for statement execution, similar to [`USE SCHEMA`] in SQL.    [`USE SCHEMA`]: https://docs.databricks.com/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-use-schema.html :param wait_timeout: str (optional)   The time in seconds the call will wait for the statement's result set as `Ns`, where `N` can be set   to 0 or to a value between 5 and 50.    When set to `0s`, the statement will execute in asynchronous mode and the call will not wait for the   execution to finish. In this case, the call returns directly with `PENDING` state and a statement ID   which can be used for polling with :method:statementexecution/getStatement.    When set between 5 and 50 seconds, the call will behave synchronously up to this timeout and wait   for the statement execution to finish. If the execution finishes within this time, the call returns   immediately with a manifest and result data (or a `FAILED` state in case of an execution error). If   the statement takes longer to execute, `on_wait_timeout` determines what should happen after the   timeout is reached.  :returns: :class:`StatementResponse`",statement_execution,execute,insert,

When the `status.state` field is `SUCCEEDED` it will also return the result manifest and the first chunk of the result data. When the statement is in the terminal states `CANCELED`, `CLOSED` or `FAILED`, it returns HTTP 200 with the state set. After at least 12 hours in terminal state, the statement is removed from the warehouse and further calls will receive an HTTP 404 response.  **NOTE** This call currently might take up to 5 seconds to get the latest status and result.  :param statement_id: str   The statement ID is returned upon successfully submitting a SQL statement, and is a required   reference for all subsequent calls.  :returns: :class:`StatementResponse`",statement_execution,get,select,
