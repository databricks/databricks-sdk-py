In case of error (due to internal server error or an invalid request), partial data may be written.  You can write metrics, params, and tags in interleaving fashion, but within a given entity type are guaranteed to follow the order specified in the request body.  The overwrite behavior for metrics, params, and tags is as follows:  * Metrics: metric values are never overwritten. Logging a metric (key, value, timestamp) appends to the set of values for the metric with the provided key.  * Tags: tag values can be overwritten by successive writes to the same tag key. That is, if multiple tag values with the same key are provided in the same API request, the last-provided tag value is written. Logging the same tag (key, value) is permitted. Specifically, logging a tag is idempotent.  * Parameters: once written, param values cannot be changed (attempting to overwrite a param value will result in an error). However, logging the same param (key, value) is permitted. Specifically, logging a param is idempotent.
