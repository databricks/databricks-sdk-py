If a file or directory already exists on the given path and __overwrite__ is set to false, this call will throw an exception with ``RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS``.  A typical workflow for file upload would be:  1. Issue a ``create`` call and get a handle. 2. Issue one or more ``add-block`` calls with the handle you have. 3. Issue a ``close`` call with the handle you have.  :param path: str   The path of the new file.

This call,"Delete the file or directory (optionally recursively delete all files in the directory). This call throws an exception with `IO_ERROR` if the path is a non-empty directory and `recursive` is set to `false` or on other similar errors.  When you delete a large number of files, the delete operation is done in increments. The call returns a response after approximately 45 seconds with an error message (503 Service Unavailable) asking you to re-invoke the delete operation until the directory structure is fully deleted.  For operations that delete more than 10K files, we discourage using the DBFS REST API, but advise you to perform such operations in the context of a cluster, using the [File system utility (dbutils.fs)](/dev-tools/databricks-utils.html#dbutils-fs). `dbutils.fs` covers the functional scope of the DBFS REST API, but from notebooks. Running such operations using notebooks provides better control and manageability, such as selective deletes, and the possibility to automate periodic delete jobs.  :param path: str   The path of the file or directory to delete.

When calling list on a large directory, the list operation will time out after approximately 60 seconds. We strongly recommend using list only on directories containing less than 10K files and discourage using the DBFS REST API for operations that list more than 10K files. Instead, we recommend that you perform such operations in the context of a cluster, using the [File system utility (dbutils.fs)](/dev-tools/databricks-utils.html#dbutils-fs), which provides the same functionality without timing out.  :param path: str   The path of the file or directory.
