The caller must be the owner of the recipient. When sharing data from Databricks to non-Databricks clients, you can define a federation policy to authenticate non-Databricks recipients. The federation policy validates OIDC claims in federated tokens and is defined at the recipient level. This enables secretless sharing clients to authenticate using OIDC tokens.  Supported scenarios for federation policies: 1. **User-to-Machine (U2M) flow** (e.g., PowerBI): A user accesses a resource using their own identity. 2. **Machine-to-Machine (M2M) flow** (e.g., OAuth App): An OAuth App accesses a resource using its own identity, typically for tasks like running nightly jobs.
