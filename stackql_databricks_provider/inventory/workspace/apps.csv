The update process is asynchronous and the status of the update can be checked with the GetAppUpdate method.  :param app_name: str :param update_mask: str   The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The   field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,   `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only   the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field   names.    A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement.
