The user could create either an external volume or a managed volume. An external volume will be created in the specified external location, while a managed volume will be located in the default location which is specified by the parent schema, or the parent catalog, or the Metastore.  For the volume creation to succeed, the user must satisfy following conditions: - The caller must be a metastore admin, or be the owner of the parent catalog and schema, or have the **USE_CATALOG** privilege on the parent catalog and the **USE_SCHEMA** privilege on the parent schema. - The caller must have **CREATE VOLUME** privilege on the parent schema.  For an external volume, following conditions also need to satisfy - The caller must have **CREATE EXTERNAL VOLUME** privilege on the external location. - There are no other tables, nor volumes existing in the specified storage location. - The specified storage location is not under the location of other tables, nor volumes, or catalogs or schemas.  :param catalog_name: str   The name of the catalog where the schema and the volume are :param schema_name: str   The name of the schema where the volume is :param name: str   The name of the volume :param volume_type: :class:`VolumeType`   The type of the volume. An external volume is located in the specified external location. A managed   volume is located in the default location which is specified by the parent schema, or the parent   catalog, or the Metastore.

catalog.json,/api/2.1/unity-catalog/volumes,volumes_list,get,ListVolumesResponseContent,"catalog, volumes","catalog_name, schema_name, include_browse, max_results, page_token",Gets an array of volumes for the current metastore under the parent catalog and schema.,"Gets an array of volumes for the current metastore under the parent catalog and schema.  The returned volumes are filtered based on the privileges of the calling user. For example, the metastore admin is able to list all the volumes. A regular user needs to be the owner or have the **READ VOLUME** privilege on the volume to receive the volumes in the response. For the latter case, the caller must also be the owner or have the **USE_CATALOG** privilege on the parent catalog and the **USE_SCHEMA** privilege on the parent schema.  There is no guarantee of a specific ordering of the elements in the array.  PAGINATION BEHAVIOR: The API is by default paginated, a page may contain zero results while still providing a next_page_token. Clients must continue reading pages until next_page_token is absent, which is the only indication that the end of results has been reached.  :param catalog_name: str   The identifier of the catalog :param schema_name: str   The identifier of the schema :param include_browse: bool (optional)   Whether to include volumes in the response for which the principal can only access selective   metadata for :param max_results: int (optional)   Maximum number of volumes to return (page length).    If not set, the page length is set to a server configured value (10000, as of 1/29/2024). - when set   to a value greater than 0, the page length is the minimum of this value and a server configured   value (10000, as of 1/29/2024); - when set to 0, the page length is set to a server configured value   (10000, as of 1/29/2024) (recommended); - when set to a value less than 0, an invalid parameter   error is returned;    Note: this parameter controls only the maximum number of volumes to return. The actual number of   volumes returned in a page may be smaller than this value, including 0, even if there are more   pages. :param page_token: str (optional)   Opaque token returned by a previous request. It must be included in the request to retrieve the next   page of results (pagination).  :returns: Iterator over :class:`VolumeInfo`",volumes,list,select,$.volumes

NOTE: we recommend using max_results=0 to use the paginated version of this API. Unpaginated calls will be deprecated soon.
