A response with HTTP status code 200 means the request has been accepted and is in progress, but does not mean that the workspace deployed successfully and is running. The initial workspace status is typically PROVISIONING. Use the workspace ID (workspace_id) field in the response to identify the new workspace and make repeated GET requests with the workspace ID and check its status. The workspace becomes available when the status changes to RUNNING.  You can share one customer-managed VPC with multiple workspaces in a single account. It is not required to create a new VPC for each workspace. However, you cannot reuse subnets or Security Groups between workspaces. If you plan to share one VPC with multiple workspaces, make sure you size your VPC and subnets accordingly. Because a Databricks Account API network configuration encapsulates this information, you cannot reuse a Databricks Account API network configuration across workspaces.

This property supports only the set of characters that are allowed in a   subdomain. To set this value, you must have a deployment name prefix. Contact your Databricks   account team to add an account deployment name prefix to your account. Workspace deployment names   follow the account prefix and a hyphen. For example, if your account's deployment prefix is acme and   the workspace deployment name is workspace-1, the JSON response for the deployment_name field   becomes acme-workspace-1. The workspace URL would be acme-workspace-1.cloud.databricks.com. You can   also set the deployment_name to the reserved keyword EMPTY if you want the deployment name to only   include the deployment prefix. For example, if your account's deployment prefix is acme and the   workspace deployment name is EMPTY, the deployment_name becomes acme only and the workspace URL is   acme.cloud.databricks.com.
