Additionally, you can create two enabled workspace-level delivery configurations per workspace for each log type, which means that the same workspace ID can occur in the workspace filter for no more than two delivery configurations per log type.  You cannot delete a log delivery configuration, but you can disable it (see [Enable or disable log delivery configuration](:method:LogDelivery/PatchStatus)).
