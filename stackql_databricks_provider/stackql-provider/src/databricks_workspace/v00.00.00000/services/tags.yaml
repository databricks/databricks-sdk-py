          The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
          field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
          `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.

          The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
          field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
          `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.
