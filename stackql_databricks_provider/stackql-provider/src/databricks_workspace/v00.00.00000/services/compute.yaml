      description: >-
        Creates a new Spark cluster. This method will acquire new instances from
        the cloud provider if

        necessary. This method is asynchronous; the returned ``cluster_id`` can
        be used to poll the cluster

        status. When this method returns, the cluster will be in a ``PENDING``
        state. The cluster will be

        usable once it enters a ``RUNNING`` state. Note: Databricks may not be
        able to acquire some of the

        requested nodes, due to cloud provider limitations (account limits, spot
        price, etc.) or transient

        network issues.


        If Databricks acquires at least 85% of the requested on-demand nodes,
        cluster creation will succeed.

        Otherwise the cluster will terminate with an informative error message.


        Rather than authoring the cluster's JSON definition from scratch,
        Databricks recommends filling out

        the [create compute UI] and then copying the generated JSON definition
        from the UI.


        [create compute UI]: https://docs.databricks.com/compute/configure.html


        :param spark_version: str
          The Spark version of the cluster, e.g. `3.3.x-scala2.11`. A list of available Spark versions can be
          retrieved by using the :method:clusters/sparkVersions API call.
        :param apply_policy_default_values: bool (optional)
          When set to true, fixed and default values from the policy will be used for fields that are omitted.
          When set to false, only fixed values from the policy will be applied.
        :param autoscale: :class:`AutoScale` (optional)
          Parameters needed in order to automatically scale clusters up and down based on load. Note:
          autoscaling works best with DB runtime versions 3.0 or later.
        :param autotermination_minutes: int (optional)
          Automatically terminates the cluster after it is inactive for this time in minutes. If not set, this
          cluster will not be automatically terminated. If specified, the threshold must be between 10 and
          10000 minutes. Users can also set this value to 0 to explicitly disable automatic termination.
        :param aws_attributes: :class:`AwsAttributes` (optional)
          Attributes related to clusters running on Amazon Web Services. If not specified at cluster creation,
          a set of default values will be used.
        :param azure_attributes: :class:`AzureAttributes` (optional)
          Attributes related to clusters running on Microsoft Azure. If not specified at cluster creation, a
          set of default values will be used.
        :param clone_from: :class:`CloneCluster` (optional)
          When specified, this clones libraries from a source cluster during the creation of a new cluster.
        :param cluster_log_conf: :class:`ClusterLogConf` (optional)
          The configuration for delivering spark logs to a long-term storage destination. Three kinds of
          destinations (DBFS, S3 and Unity Catalog volumes) are supported. Only one destination can be
          specified for one cluster. If the conf is given, the logs will be delivered to the destination every
          `5 mins`. The destination of driver logs is `$destination/$clusterId/driver`, while the destination
          of executor logs is `$destination/$clusterId/executor`.
        :param cluster_name: str (optional)
          Cluster name requested by the user. This doesn't have to be unique. If not specified at creation,
          the cluster name will be an empty string. For job clusters, the cluster name is automatically set
          based on the job and job run IDs.
        :param custom_tags: Dict[str,str] (optional)
          Additional tags for cluster resources. Databricks will tag all cluster resources (e.g., AWS
          instances and EBS volumes) with these tags in addition to `default_tags`. Notes:

          - Currently, Databricks allows at most 45 custom tags

          - Clusters can only reuse cloud resources if the resources' tags are a subset of the cluster tags
        :param data_security_mode: :class:`DataSecurityMode` (optional)

        :param docker_image: :class:`DockerImage` (optional)
          Custom docker image BYOC
        :param driver_instance_pool_id: str (optional)
          The optional ID of the instance pool for the driver of the cluster belongs. The pool cluster uses
          the instance pool with id (instance_pool_id) if the driver pool is not assigned.
        :param driver_node_type_flexibility: :class:`NodeTypeFlexibility`
        (optional)
          Flexible node type configuration for the driver node.
        :param driver_node_type_id: str (optional)
          The node type of the Spark driver. Note that this field is optional; if unset, the driver node type
          will be set as the same value as `node_type_id` defined above.

          This field, along with node_type_id, should not be set if virtual_cluster_size is set. If both
          driver_node_type_id, node_type_id, and virtual_cluster_size are specified, driver_node_type_id and
          node_type_id take precedence.
        :param enable_elastic_disk: bool (optional)
          Autoscaling Local Storage: when enabled, this cluster will dynamically acquire additional disk space
          when its Spark workers are running low on disk space.
        :param enable_local_disk_encryption: bool (optional)
          Whether to enable LUKS on cluster VMs' local disks
        :param gcp_attributes: :class:`GcpAttributes` (optional)
          Attributes related to clusters running on Google Cloud Platform. If not specified at cluster
          creation, a set of default values will be used.
        :param init_scripts: List[:class:`InitScriptInfo`] (optional)
          The configuration for storing init scripts. Any number of destinations can be specified. The scripts
          are executed sequentially in the order provided. If `cluster_log_conf` is specified, init script
          logs are sent to `<destination>/<cluster-ID>/init_scripts`.
        :param instance_pool_id: str (optional)
          The optional ID of the instance pool to which the cluster belongs.
        :param is_single_node: bool (optional)
          This field can only be used when `kind = CLASSIC_PREVIEW`.

          When set to true, Databricks will automatically set single node related `custom_tags`, `spark_conf`,
          and `num_workers`
        :param kind: :class:`Kind` (optional)

        :param node_type_id: str (optional)
          This field encodes, through a single value, the resources available to each of the Spark nodes in
          this cluster. For example, the Spark nodes can be provisioned and optimized for memory or compute
          intensive workloads. A list of available node types can be retrieved by using the
          :method:clusters/listNodeTypes API call.
        :param num_workers: int (optional)
          Number of worker nodes that this cluster should have. A cluster has one Spark Driver and
          `num_workers` Executors for a total of `num_workers` + 1 Spark nodes.

          Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number of workers
          rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster is resized from 5 to 10
          workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect the target size of 10 workers, whereas
          the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are
          provisioned.
        :param policy_id: str (optional)
          The ID of the cluster policy used to create the cluster if applicable.
        :param remote_disk_throughput: int (optional)
          If set, what the configurable throughput (in Mb/s) for the remote disk is. Currently only supported
          for GCP HYPERDISK_BALANCED disks.
        :param runtime_engine: :class:`RuntimeEngine` (optional)
          Determines the cluster's runtime engine, either standard or Photon.

          This field is not compatible with legacy `spark_version` values that contain `-photon-`. Remove
          `-photon-` from the `spark_version` and set `runtime_engine` to `PHOTON`.

          If left unspecified, the runtime engine defaults to standard unless the spark_version contains
          -photon-, in which case Photon will be used.
        :param single_user_name: str (optional)
          Single user name if data_security_mode is `SINGLE_USER`
        :param spark_conf: Dict[str,str] (optional)
          An object containing a set of optional, user-specified Spark configuration key-value pairs. Users
          can also pass in a string of extra JVM options to the driver and the executors via
          `spark.driver.extraJavaOptions` and `spark.executor.extraJavaOptions` respectively.
        :param spark_env_vars: Dict[str,str] (optional)
          An object containing a set of optional, user-specified environment variable key-value pairs. Please
          note that key-value pair of the form (X,Y) will be exported as is (i.e., `export X='Y'`) while
          launching the driver and workers.

          In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending them to
          `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all default databricks
          managed environmental variables are included as well.

          Example Spark environment variables: `{"SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY": "28000m", "SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS":
          "/local_disk0"}` or `{"SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS": "$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS
          -Dspark.shuffle.service.enabled=true"}`
        :param ssh_public_keys: List[str] (optional)
          SSH public key contents that will be added to each Spark node in this cluster. The corresponding
          private keys can be used to login with the user name `ubuntu` on port `2200`. Up to 10 keys can be
          specified.
        :param total_initial_remote_disk_size: int (optional)
          If set, what the total initial volume size (in GB) of the remote disks should be. Currently only
          supported for GCP HYPERDISK_BALANCED disks.
        :param use_ml_runtime: bool (optional)
          This field can only be used when `kind = CLASSIC_PREVIEW`.

          `effective_spark_version` is determined by `spark_version` (DBR release), this field
          `use_ml_runtime`, and whether `node_type_id` is gpu node or not.
        :param worker_node_type_flexibility: :class:`NodeTypeFlexibility`
        (optional)
          Flexible node type configuration for worker nodes.
        :param workload_type: :class:`WorkloadType` (optional)


        :returns:
          Long-running operation waiter for :class:`ClusterDetails`.

          driver_node_type_id, node_type_id, and virtual_cluster_size are specified, driver_node_type_id and
          node_type_id take precedence.
        :param enable_elastic_disk: bool (optional)
          Autoscaling Local Storage: when enabled, this cluster will dynamically acquire additional disk space
          when its Spark workers are running low on disk space.
        :param enable_local_disk_encryption: bool (optional)
          Whether to enable LUKS on cluster VMs' local disks
        :param gcp_attributes: :class:`GcpAttributes` (optional)
          Attributes related to clusters running on Google Cloud Platform. If not specified at cluster
          creation, a set of default values will be used.
        :param init_scripts: List[:class:`InitScriptInfo`] (optional)
          The configuration for storing init scripts. Any number of destinations can be specified. The scripts
          are executed sequentially in the order provided. If `cluster_log_conf` is specified, init script
          logs are sent to `<destination>/<cluster-ID>/init_scripts`.
        :param instance_pool_id: str (optional)
          The optional ID of the instance pool to which the cluster belongs.
        :param is_single_node: bool (optional)
          This field can only be used when `kind = CLASSIC_PREVIEW`.

          When set to true, Databricks will automatically set single node related `custom_tags`, `spark_conf`,
          and `num_workers`
        :param kind: :class:`Kind` (optional)

        :param node_type_id: str (optional)
          This field encodes, through a single value, the resources available to each of the Spark nodes in
          this cluster. For example, the Spark nodes can be provisioned and optimized for memory or compute
          intensive workloads. A list of available node types can be retrieved by using the
          :method:clusters/listNodeTypes API call.
        :param num_workers: int (optional)
          Number of worker nodes that this cluster should have. A cluster has one Spark Driver and
          `num_workers` Executors for a total of `num_workers` + 1 Spark nodes.

          Note: When reading the properties of a cluster, this field reflects the desired number of workers
          rather than the actual current number of workers. For instance, if a cluster is resized from 5 to 10
          workers, this field will immediately be updated to reflect the target size of 10 workers, whereas
          the workers listed in `spark_info` will gradually increase from 5 to 10 as the new nodes are
          provisioned.
        :param policy_id: str (optional)
          The ID of the cluster policy used to create the cluster if applicable.
        :param remote_disk_throughput: int (optional)
          If set, what the configurable throughput (in Mb/s) for the remote disk is. Currently only supported
          for GCP HYPERDISK_BALANCED disks.
        :param runtime_engine: :class:`RuntimeEngine` (optional)
          Determines the cluster's runtime engine, either standard or Photon.

          This field is not compatible with legacy `spark_version` values that contain `-photon-`. Remove
          `-photon-` from the `spark_version` and set `runtime_engine` to `PHOTON`.

          If left unspecified, the runtime engine defaults to standard unless the spark_version contains
          -photon-, in which case Photon will be used.
        :param single_user_name: str (optional)
          Single user name if data_security_mode is `SINGLE_USER`
        :param spark_conf: Dict[str,str] (optional)
          An object containing a set of optional, user-specified Spark configuration key-value pairs. Users
          can also pass in a string of extra JVM options to the driver and the executors via
          `spark.driver.extraJavaOptions` and `spark.executor.extraJavaOptions` respectively.
        :param spark_env_vars: Dict[str,str] (optional)
          An object containing a set of optional, user-specified environment variable key-value pairs. Please
          note that key-value pair of the form (X,Y) will be exported as is (i.e., `export X='Y'`) while
          launching the driver and workers.

          In order to specify an additional set of `SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS`, we recommend appending them to
          `$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS` as shown in the example below. This ensures that all default databricks
          managed environmental variables are included as well.

          Example Spark environment variables: `{"SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY": "28000m", "SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS":
          "/local_disk0"}` or `{"SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS": "$SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS
          -Dspark.shuffle.service.enabled=true"}`
        :param ssh_public_keys: List[str] (optional)
          SSH public key contents that will be added to each Spark node in this cluster. The corresponding
          private keys can be used to login with the user name `ubuntu` on port `2200`. Up to 10 keys can be
          specified.
        :param total_initial_remote_disk_size: int (optional)
          If set, what the total initial volume size (in GB) of the remote disks should be. Currently only
          supported for GCP HYPERDISK_BALANCED disks.
        :param use_ml_runtime: bool (optional)
          This field can only be used when `kind = CLASSIC_PREVIEW`.

          `effective_spark_version` is determined by `spark_version` (DBR release), this field
          `use_ml_runtime`, and whether `node_type_id` is gpu node or not.
        :param worker_node_type_flexibility: :class:`NodeTypeFlexibility`
        (optional)
          Flexible node type configuration for worker nodes.
        :param workload_type: :class:`WorkloadType` (optional)


        :returns:
          Long-running operation waiter for :class:`ClusterDetails`.

          Automatically terminates the extra instances in the pool cache after they are inactive for this time
          in minutes if min_idle_instances requirement is already met. If not set, the extra pool instances
          will be automatically terminated after a default timeout. If specified, the threshold must be
          between 0 and 10000 minutes. Users can also set this value to 0 to instantly remove idle instances
          from the cache if min cache size could still hold.
        :param max_capacity: int (optional)
          Maximum number of outstanding instances to keep in the pool, including both instances used by
          clusters and idle instances. Clusters that require further instance provisioning will fail during

          will be automatically terminated after a default timeout. If specified, the threshold must be
          between 0 and 10000 minutes. Users can also set this value to 0 to instantly remove idle instances
          from the cache if min cache size could still hold.
        :param max_capacity: int (optional)
          Maximum number of outstanding instances to keep in the pool, including both instances used by
          clusters and idle instances. Clusters that require further instance provisioning will fail during
          upsize requests.

        :param is_meta_instance_profile: bool (optional)
          Boolean flag indicating whether the instance profile should only be used in credential passthrough
          scenarios. If true, it means the instance profile contains an meta IAM role which could assume a
          wide range of roles. Therefore it should always be used with authorization. This field is optional,
          the default value is `false`.
        :param skip_validation: bool (optional)
          By default, Databricks validates that it has sufficient permissions to launch instances with the
          instance profile. This validation uses AWS dry-run mode for the RunInstances API. If validation
          fails with an error message that does not indicate an IAM related permission issue, (e.g. “Your
          requested instance type is not supported in your requested availability zone”), you can pass this
          flag to skip the validation and forcibly add the instance profile.

            types with no instance store, at least one EBS volume needs to be
            specified; otherwise, cluster creation will fail. These EBS volumes
            will be mounted at `/ebs0`, `/ebs1`, and etc. Instance store volumes
            will be mounted at `/local_disk0`, `/local_disk1`, and etc. If EBS
            volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use only
            the EBS volumes for scratch storage because heterogenously sized
            scratch devices can lead to inefficient disk utilization. If no EBS
            volumes are attached, Databricks will configure Spark to use
            instance store volumes. Please note that if EBS volumes are

            field is set to 50, and the cluster needs a new `r3.xlarge` spot
            instance, then the bid price is half of the price of on-demand
            `r3.xlarge` instances. Similarly, if this field is set to 200, the
            bid price is twice the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. If
            not specified, the default value is 100. When spot instances are
            requested for this cluster, only spot instances whose bid price
            percentage matches this field will be considered. Note that, for
            safety, we enforce this field to be no more than 10000.

            provided availability zone must be in the same region as the
            Databricks deployment. For example, "us-west-2a" is not a valid zone
            id if the Databricks deployment resides in the "us-east-1" region.
            This is an optional field at cluster creation, and if not specified,
            the zone "auto" will be used. If the zone specified is "auto", will
            try to place cluster in a zone with high availability, and will
            retry placement in a different AZ if there is not enough capacity.
            The list of available zones as well as the default value can be

            spot instance, then the bid price is half of the price of on-demand
            `r3.xlarge` instances. Similarly, if this field is set to 200, the
            bid price is twice the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. If
            not specified, the default value is 100. When spot instances are
            requested for this cluster, only spot instances whose bid price

            This is an optional field at instance pool creation, and if not

        Data security mode decides what data governance model to use when
        accessing data from a cluster.


        The following modes can only be used when `kind = CLASSIC_PREVIEW`. *
        `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_AUTO`:

        Databricks will choose the most appropriate access mode depending on
        your compute configuration.

        * `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_STANDARD`: Alias for `USER_ISOLATION`. *
        `DATA_SECURITY_MODE_DEDICATED`:

        Alias for `SINGLE_USER`.


        The following modes can be used regardless of `kind`. * `NONE`: No
        security isolation for

        multiple users sharing the cluster. Data governance features are not
        available in this mode. *

        `SINGLE_USER`: A secure cluster that can only be exclusively used by a
        single user specified in

        `single_user_name`. Most programming languages, cluster features and
        data governance features

        are available in this mode. * `USER_ISOLATION`: A secure cluster that
        can be shared by multiple

        users. Cluster users are fully isolated so that they cannot see each
        other's data and

        credentials. Most data governance features are supported in this mode.
        But programming languages

        and cluster features might be limited.


        The following modes are deprecated starting with Databricks Runtime 15.0
        and will be removed for

        future Databricks Runtime versions:


        * `LEGACY_TABLE_ACL`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy Table
        ACL clusters. *

        `LEGACY_PASSTHROUGH`: This mode is for users migrating from legacy
        Passthrough on high

        concurrency clusters. * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER`: This mode is for users
        migrating from legacy

        Passthrough on standard clusters. * `LEGACY_SINGLE_USER_STANDARD`: This
        mode provides a way that

        doesn’t have UC nor passthrough enabled.
