        Creates a new pipeline using Unity Catalog from a pipeline using Hive
        Metastore. This method returns

        the ID of the newly created clone. Additionally, this method starts an
        update for the newly created

        pipeline.


        :param pipeline_id: str
          Source pipeline to clone from
        :param allow_duplicate_names: bool (optional)
          If false, deployment will fail if name conflicts with that of another pipeline.

          Budget policy of this pipeline.
        :param catalog: str (optional)
          A catalog in Unity Catalog to publish data from this pipeline to. If `target` is specified, tables
          in this pipeline are published to a `target` schema inside `catalog` (for example,
          `catalog`.`target`.`table`). If `target` is not specified, no data is published to Unity Catalog.
        :param channel: str (optional)
          DLT Release Channel that specifies which version to use.
        :param clone_mode: :class:`CloneMode` (optional)
          The type of clone to perform. Currently, only deep copies are supported
        :param clusters: List[:class:`PipelineCluster`] (optional)

          String-String configuration for this pipeline execution.
        :param continuous: bool (optional)
          Whether the pipeline is continuous or triggered. This replaces `trigger`.
        :param deployment: :class:`PipelineDeployment` (optional)
          Deployment type of this pipeline.

          Event log configuration for this pipeline
        :param expected_last_modified: int (optional)
          If present, the last-modified time of the pipeline settings before the clone. If the settings were
          modified after that time, then the request will fail with a conflict.
        :param filters: :class:`Filters` (optional)
          Filters on which Pipeline packages to include in the deployed graph.
        :param gateway_definition: :class:`IngestionGatewayPipelineDefinition`

          Restart window of this pipeline.
        :param root_path: str (optional)
          Root path for this pipeline. This is used as the root directory when editing the pipeline in the

          execution.
        :param schema: str (optional)

          DBFS root directory for storing checkpoints and tables.
        :param tags: Dict[str,str] (optional)
          A map of tags associated with the pipeline. These are forwarded to the cluster as cluster tags, and
          are therefore subject to the same limitations. A maximum of 25 tags can be added to the pipeline.
        :param target: str (optional)
          Target schema (database) to add tables in this pipeline to. Exactly one of `schema` or `target` must
          be specified. To publish to Unity Catalog, also specify `catalog`. This legacy field is deprecated

        :param trigger: :class:`PipelineTrigger` (optional)
          Which pipeline trigger to use. Deprecated: Use `continuous` instead.
        :param usage_policy_id: str (optional)

            The names of the monotonically increasing columns in the source

            incrementally through structured streaming. The columns are allowed
            to have repeated values but have to be non-decreasing. If the source
            data is merged into the destination (e.g., using SCD Type 1 or Type

        deletion_condition:

            For example: "Operation = 'DELETE'" or "is_deleted = true". This
            field is orthogonal to `hard_deletion_sync_interval_in_seconds`, one
            for soft-deletes and the other for hard-deletes. See also the
            hard_deletion_sync_min_interval_in_seconds field for handling of
            "hard deletes" where the source rows are physically removed from the
            table.
        hard_deletion_sync_min_interval_in_seconds:

            primary keys for detecting and synchronizing hard deletions—i.e.,
            rows that have been physically removed from the source table. This
            interval acts as a lower bound. If ingestion runs less frequently
            than this value, hard deletion synchronization will align with the
            actual ingestion frequency instead of happening more often. If not
            set, hard deletion synchronization via snapshots is disabled. This
            field is mutable and can be updated without triggering a full
            snapshot.

        Example enumeration:

        ...     RED = 1
        ...     BLUE = 2
        ...     GREEN = 3

        Access them by:

        - attribute access:

          >>> Color.RED
          <Color.RED: 1>

        - value lookup:

          >>> Color(1)
          <Color.RED: 1>

        - name lookup:

          >>> Color['RED']
          <Color.RED: 1>

        Enumerations can be iterated over, and know how many members they have:

        >>> len(Color)
        3

        >>> list(Color)
        [<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.BLUE: 2>, <Color.GREEN: 3>]

        Methods can be added to enumerations, and members can have their own
        attributes -- see the documentation for details.
