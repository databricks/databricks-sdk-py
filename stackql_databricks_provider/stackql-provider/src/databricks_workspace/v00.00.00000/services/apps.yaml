        Creates a new app.

        :param app: :class:`App`
        :param no_compute: bool (optional)
          If true, the app will not be started after creation.

        :returns:
          Long-running operation waiter for :class:`App`.

                            source code path used by the deployment.

                        Create a collection of name/value pairs.

                        Example enumeration:

                        >>> class Color(Enum):
                        ...     RED = 1

                        ...     GREEN = 3

                        Access them by:

                        - attribute access::

                        >>> Color.RED
                        <Color.RED: 1>

                        >>> Color(1)

                        >>> Color['RED']
                        <Color.RED: 1>

                        Enumerations can be iterated over, and know how many members they have:

                        >>> len(Color)
                        3

                        >>> list(Color)
                        [<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.BLUE: 2>, <Color.GREEN: 3>]

                        Methods can be added to enumerations, and members can have their own
                        attributes -- see the documentation for details.

        :param app_name: str
        :param update_mask: str
          The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
          field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
          `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.

                        ...     GREEN = 3

                        Access them by:

                        - attribute access::

                        >>> Color.RED
                        <Color.RED: 1>

                        <Color.RED: 1>

                        Enumerations can be iterated over, and know how many members they have:

                        >>> len(Color)
                        3

                        >>> list(Color)
                        [<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.BLUE: 2>, <Color.GREEN: 3>]

                        Methods can be added to enumerations, and members can have their own
                        attributes -- see the documentation for details.

                        Example enumeration:

                        >>> class Color(Enum):
                        ...     RED = 1

                        ...     GREEN = 3

                        Access them by:

                        - attribute access::

                        >>> Color.RED

                        <Color.RED: 1>

                        Enumerations can be iterated over, and know how many members they have:

                        >>> len(Color)
                        3

                        >>> list(Color)
                        [<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.BLUE: 2>, <Color.GREEN: 3>]

                        Methods can be added to enumerations, and members can have their own
                        attributes -- see the documentation for details.

                                      Create a collection of name/value pairs.

                                      Example enumeration:

                                      >>> class Color(Enum):
                                      ...     RED = 1
                                      ...     BLUE = 2
                                      ...     GREEN = 3

                                      Access them by:

                                      - attribute access::

                                      >>> Color.RED
                                      <Color.RED: 1>

                                      - value lookup:

                                      >>> Color(1)
                                      <Color.RED: 1>

                                      - name lookup:

                                      >>> Color['RED']
                                      <Color.RED: 1>

                                      Enumerations can be iterated over, and know how many members they have:

                                      >>> len(Color)
                                      3

                                      >>> list(Color)
                                      [<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.BLUE: 2>, <Color.GREEN: 3>]

                                      Methods can be added to enumerations, and members can have their own
                                      attributes -- see the documentation for details.
