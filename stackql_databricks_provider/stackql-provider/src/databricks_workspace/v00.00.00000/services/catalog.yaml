        retrieved. Otherwise, only catalogs owned by the caller (or for which
        the caller has the

        **USE_CATALOG** privilege) will be retrieved. There is no guarantee of a
        specific ordering of the

        elements in the array.


        NOTE: we recommend using max_results=0 to use the paginated version of
        this API. Unpaginated calls

        will be deprecated soon.


        PAGINATION BEHAVIOR: When using pagination (max_results >= 0), a page
        may contain zero results while

        still providing a next_page_token. Clients must continue reading pages
        until next_page_token is

        absent, which is the only indication that the end of results has been
        reached.


        :param include_browse: bool (optional)

          Whether to include catalogs not bound to the workspace. Effective only if the user has permission to
          update the catalog–workspace binding.
        :param max_results: int (optional)
          Maximum number of catalogs to return. - when set to 0, the page length is set to a server configured
          value (recommended); - when set to a value greater than 0, the page length is the minimum of this
          value and a server configured value; - when set to a value less than 0, an invalid parameter error
          is returned; - If not set, all valid catalogs are returned (not recommended). - Note: The number of
          returned catalogs might be less than the specified max_results size, even zero. The only definitive
          indication that no further catalogs can be fetched is when the next_page_token is unset from the
          response.

        NOTE: we recommend using max_results=0 to use the paginated version of
        this API. Unpaginated calls

        will be deprecated soon.


        PAGINATION BEHAVIOR: When using pagination (max_results >= 0), a page
        may contain zero results while

        still providing a next_page_token. Clients must continue reading pages
        until next_page_token is

        absent, which is the only indication that the end of results has been
        reached.


        :param max_results: int (optional)
          Maximum number of connections to return. - If not set, all connections are returned (not
          recommended). - when set to a value greater than 0, the page length is the minimum of this value and
          a server configured value; - when set to 0, the page length is set to a server configured value
          (recommended); - when set to a value less than 0, an invalid parameter error is returned;
        :param page_token: str (optional)
          Opaque pagination token to go to next page based on previous query.

        Updates an existing tag assignment for an Unity Catalog entity.


        To update tags to Unity Catalog entities, you must own the entity or
        have the following privileges: -

        **APPLY TAG** on the entity - **USE SCHEMA** on the entity's parent
        schema - **USE CATALOG** on the

        entity's parent catalog


        To update a governed tag to Unity Catalog entities, you must also have
        the **ASSIGN** or **MANAGE**

        permission on the tag policy. See [Manage tag policy permissions].


        [Manage tag policy permissions]:
        https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/tag-policies/manage-permissions


        :param entity_type: str
          The type of the entity to which the tag is assigned. Allowed values are: catalogs, schemas, tables,
          columns, volumes.
        :param entity_name: str
          The fully qualified name of the entity to which the tag is assigned
        :param tag_key: str

        :param update_mask: str
          The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
          field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
          `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.

        Gets an array of external locations (__ExternalLocationInfo__ objects)
        from the metastore. The caller

        must be a metastore admin, the owner of the external location, or a user
        that has some privilege on

        the external location. There is no guarantee of a specific ordering of
        the elements in the array.


        NOTE: we recommend using max_results=0 to use the paginated version of
        this API. Unpaginated calls

        will be deprecated soon.


        PAGINATION BEHAVIOR: When using pagination (max_results >= 0), a page
        may contain zero results while

        still providing a next_page_token. Clients must continue reading pages
        until next_page_token is

        absent, which is the only indication that the end of results has been
        reached.

          permission to update the location–workspace binding.

          Maximum number of external locations to return. If not set, all the external locations are returned
          (not recommended). - when set to a value greater than 0, the page length is the minimum of this
          value and a server configured value; - when set to 0, the page length is set to a server configured
          value (recommended); - when set to a value less than 0, an invalid parameter error is returned;
        :param page_token: str (optional)

        PAGINATION BEHAVIOR: When using pagination (max_results >= 0), a page
        may contain zero results while

        still providing a next_page_token. Clients must continue reading pages
        until next_page_token is

        absent, which is the only indication that the end of results has been
        reached.

        NOTE: we recommend using max_results=0 to use the paginated version of
        this API. Unpaginated calls

        will be deprecated soon.


        PAGINATION BEHAVIOR: When using pagination (max_results >= 0), a page
        may contain zero results while

        still providing a next_page_token. Clients must continue reading pages
        until next_page_token is

        absent, which is the only indication that the end of results has been
        reached.

        NOTE: we recommend using max_results=0 to use the paginated version of
        this API. Unpaginated calls

        will be deprecated soon.


        PAGINATION BEHAVIOR: When using pagination (max_results >= 0), a page
        may contain zero results while

        still providing a next_page_token. Clients must continue reading pages
        until next_page_token is

        absent, which is the only indication that the end of results has been
        reached.


        :param max_results: int (optional)
          Maximum number of metastores to return. - when set to a value greater than 0, the page length is the
          minimum of this value and a server configured value; - when set to 0, the page length is set to a
          server configured value (recommended); - when set to a value less than 0, an invalid parameter error
          is returned; - If not set, all the metastores are returned (not recommended). - Note: The number of
          returned metastores might be less than the specified max_results size, even zero. The only
          definitive indication that no further metastores can be fetched is when the next_page_token is unset
          from the response.
        :param page_token: str (optional)
          Opaque pagination token to go to next page based on previous query.

        schema, or list all model versions

        in the current metastore.


        The returned models are filtered based on the privileges of the calling
        user. For example, the

        metastore admin is able to list all the model versions. A regular user
        needs to be the owner or have

        the **EXECUTE** privilege on the parent registered model to recieve the
        model versions in the

        response. For the latter case, the caller must also be the owner or have
        the **USE_CATALOG** privilege

        on the parent catalog and the **USE_SCHEMA** privilege on the parent
        schema.


        There is no guarantee of a specific ordering of the elements in the
        response. The elements in the

        response will not contain any aliases or tags.


        PAGINATION BEHAVIOR: The API is by default paginated, a page may contain
        zero results while still

        providing a next_page_token. Clients must continue reading pages until
        next_page_token is absent,

        which is the only indication that the end of results has been reached.

        Generic Webhook destinations) can be assigned to a securable. If a URL

          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.

        may contain zero results while

        still providing a next_page_token. Clients must continue reading pages
        until next_page_token is

        PAGINATION BEHAVIOR: When using pagination (max_results >= 0), a page
        may contain zero results while

        still providing a next_page_token. Clients must continue reading pages
        until next_page_token is

        absent, which is the only indication that the end of results has been
        reached.


        :param include_unbound: bool (optional)
          Whether to include credentials not bound to the workspace. Effective only if the user has permission
          to update the credential–workspace binding.
        :param max_results: int (optional)
          Maximum number of storage credentials to return. If not set, all the storage credentials are
          returned (not recommended). - when set to a value greater than 0, the page length is the minimum of
          this value and a server configured value; - when set to 0, the page length is set to a server
          configured value (recommended); - when set to a value less than 0, an invalid parameter error is
          returned;
        :param page_token: str (optional)
          Opaque pagination token to go to next page based on previous query.

        PAGINATION BEHAVIOR: When using pagination (max_results >= 0), a page
        may contain zero results while

        still providing a next_page_token. Clients must continue reading pages
        until next_page_token is

        absent, which is the only indication that the end of results has been
        reached.

          value and a server configured value; - When set to a value less than 0, an invalid parameter error
          is returned; - If not set, all the schemas are returned (not recommended).

        To create an external delta table, the caller must have the
        **EXTERNAL_USE_SCHEMA** privilege on the

        parent schema and the **EXTERNAL_USE_LOCATION** privilege on the
        external location. These privileges

        must always be granted explicitly, and cannot be inherited through
        ownership or **ALL_PRIVILEGES**.


        Standard UC permissions needed to create tables still apply:
        **USE_CATALOG** on the parent catalog (or

        ownership of the parent catalog), **CREATE_TABLE** and **USE_SCHEMA** on
        the parent schema (or

        ownership of the parent schema), and **CREATE_EXTERNAL_TABLE** on
        external location.


        The **columns** field needs to be in a Spark compatible format, so we
        recommend you use Spark to

        create these tables. The API itself does not validate the correctness of
        the column spec. If the spec

        is not Spark compatible, the tables may not be readable by Databricks
        Runtime.


        NOTE: The Create Table API for external clients only supports creating
        **external delta tables**. The

        values shown in the respective enums are all values supported by
        Databricks, however for this specific

        Create Table API, only **table_type** **EXTERNAL** and
        **data_source_format** **DELTA** are supported.

        Additionally, column masks are not supported when creating tables
        through this API.

        Creates a new volume.


        The user could create either an external volume or a managed volume. An
        external volume will be

        created in the specified external location, while a managed volume will
        be located in the default

        location which is specified by the parent schema, or the parent catalog,
        or the Metastore.


        For the volume creation to succeed, the user must satisfy following
        conditions: - The caller must be a

        metastore admin, or be the owner of the parent catalog and schema, or
        have the **USE_CATALOG**

        privilege on the parent catalog and the **USE_SCHEMA** privilege on the
        parent schema. - The caller

        must have **CREATE VOLUME** privilege on the parent schema.


        For an external volume, following conditions also need to satisfy - The
        caller must have **CREATE

        EXTERNAL VOLUME** privilege on the external location. - There are no
        other tables, nor volumes

        existing in the specified storage location. - The specified storage
        location is not under the location

        of other tables, nor volumes, or catalogs or schemas.

        The returned volumes are filtered based on the privileges of the calling
        user. For example, the

        metastore admin is able to list all the volumes. A regular user needs to
        be the owner or have the

        **READ VOLUME** privilege on the volume to receive the volumes in the
        response. For the latter case,

        the caller must also be the owner or have the **USE_CATALOG** privilege
        on the parent catalog and the

        **USE_SCHEMA** privilege on the parent schema.


        There is no guarantee of a specific ordering of the elements in the
        array.


        PAGINATION BEHAVIOR: The API is by default paginated, a page may contain
        zero results while still

        providing a next_page_token. Clients must continue reading pages until
        next_page_token is absent,

        which is the only indication that the end of results has been reached.

        :param max_results: int (optional)
          Maximum number of volumes to return (page length).

          If not set, the page length is set to a server configured value (10000, as of 1/29/2024). - when set
          to a value greater than 0, the page length is the minimum of this value and a server configured
          value (10000, as of 1/29/2024); - when set to 0, the page length is set to a server configured value
          (10000, as of 1/29/2024) (recommended); - when set to a value less than 0, an invalid parameter
          error is returned;

          Note: this parameter controls only the maximum number of volumes to return. The actual number of
          volumes returned in a page may be smaller than this value, including 0, even if there are more
          pages.
        :param page_token: str (optional)

        NOTE: we recommend using max_results=0 to use the paginated version of
        this API. Unpaginated calls

        will be deprecated soon.


        PAGINATION BEHAVIOR: When using pagination (max_results >= 0), a page
        may contain zero results while

        still providing a next_page_token. Clients must continue reading pages
        until next_page_token is

        absent, which is the only indication that the end of results has been
        reached.

          configured value (recommended); - When set to a value greater than 0, the page length is the minimum
          of this value and a server configured value; - When set to a value less than 0, an invalid parameter
          error is returned; - If not set, all the workspace bindings are returned (not recommended).
