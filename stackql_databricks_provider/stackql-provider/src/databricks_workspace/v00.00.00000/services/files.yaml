        throws an exception with `IO_ERROR` if the path is a non-empty directory
        and `recursive` is set to

        `false` or on other similar errors.


        When you delete a large number of files, the delete operation is done in
        increments. The call returns

        a response after approximately 45 seconds with an error message (503
        Service Unavailable) asking you

        to re-invoke the delete operation until the directory structure is fully
        deleted.


        For operations that delete more than 10K files, we discourage using the
        DBFS REST API, but advise you

        to perform such operations in the context of a cluster, using the [File
        system utility

        (dbutils.fs)](/dev-tools/databricks-utils.html#dbutils-fs). `dbutils.fs`
        covers the functional scope

        of the DBFS REST API, but from notebooks. Running such operations using
        notebooks provides better

        control and manageability, such as selective deletes, and the
        possibility to automate periodic delete

        jobs.


        :param path: str
          The path of the file or directory to delete. The path should be the absolute DBFS path.
        :param recursive: bool (optional)

        When calling list on a large directory, the list operation will time out
        after approximately 60

        seconds. We strongly recommend using list only on directories containing
        less than 10K files and

        discourage using the DBFS REST API for operations that list more than
        10K files. Instead, we recommend

        To delete a non-empty directory, first delete all of its contents. This
        can be done by listing the

        directory contents and deleting each file and subdirectory recursively.

        This method is useful to check if a directory exists and the caller has
        access to it.


        If you wish to ensure the directory exists, you can instead use `PUT`,
        which will create the directory

        if it does not exist, and is idempotent (it will succeed if the
        directory already exists).

          We recommend not to set this value unless you are intentionally listing less than the complete
          directory contents.

          If unspecified, at most 1000 directory entries will be returned. The maximum value is 1000. Values

          An opaque page token which was the `next_page_token` in the response of the previous request to list
          the contents of this directory. Provide this token to retrieve the next page of directory entries.
          When providing a `page_token`, all other parameters provided to the request must match the previous
          request. To list all of the entries in a directory, it is necessary to continue requesting pages of
          entries until the response contains no `next_page_token`. Note that the number of entries returned
