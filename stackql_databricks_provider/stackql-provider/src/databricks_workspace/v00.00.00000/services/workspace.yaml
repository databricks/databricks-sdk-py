        Creates a Git credential entry for the user. Only one Git credential per
        user is supported, so any

        attempts to create credentials if an entry already exists will fail. Use
        the PATCH endpoint to update

        existing credentials, or the DELETE endpoint to delete existing
        credentials.


        :param git_provider: str

        Creates a new secret scope.


        The scope name must consist of alphanumeric characters, dashes,
        underscores, and periods, and may not

        exceed 128 characters.


        Example request:


        .. code::


        { "scope": "my-simple-databricks-scope", "initial_manage_principal":
        "users" "scope_backend_type":

        "databricks|azure_keyvault", # below is only required if scope type is
        azure_keyvault

        "backend_azure_keyvault": { "resource_id":

        "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/xxxx/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/xxxx",

        "tenant_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "dns_name":
        "https://xxxx.vault.azure.net/", } }


        If ``initial_manage_principal`` is specified, the initial ACL applied to
        the scope is applied to the

        supplied principal (user or group) with ``MANAGE`` permissions. The only
        supported principal for this

        option is the group ``users``, which contains all users in the
        workspace. If

        ``initial_manage_principal`` is not specified, the initial ACL with
        ``MANAGE`` permission applied to

        the scope is assigned to the API request issuer's user identity.


        If ``scope_backend_type`` is ``azure_keyvault``, a secret scope is
        created with secrets from a given

        Azure KeyVault. The caller must provide the keyvault_resource_id and the
        tenant_id for the key vault.

        If ``scope_backend_type`` is ``databricks`` or is unspecified, an empty
        secret scope is created and

        stored in Databricks's own storage.


        Throws ``RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS`` if a scope with the given name
        already exists. Throws

        ``RESOURCE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`` if maximum number of scopes in the workspace
        is exceeded. Throws

        ``INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE`` if the scope name is invalid. Throws
        ``BAD_REQUEST`` if request violated

        constraints. Throws ``CUSTOMER_UNAUTHORIZED`` if normal user attempts to
        create a scope with name

        reserved for databricks internal usage. Throws ``UNAUTHENTICATED`` if
        unable to verify user access

        permission on Azure KeyVault


        :param scope: str
          Scope name requested by the user. Scope names are unique.

        scope point. In general, a user or group will use the most powerful
        permission available to them, and

        permissions are ordered as follows:


        * ``MANAGE`` - Allowed to change ACLs, and read and write to this secret
        scope. * ``WRITE`` - Allowed

        to read and write to this secret scope. * ``READ`` - Allowed to read
        this secret scope and list what

        secrets are available.


        Note that in general, secret values can only be read from within a
        command on a cluster (for example,

        through a notebook). There is no API to read the actual secret value
        material outside of a cluster.

        However, the user's permission will be applied based on who is executing
        the command, and they must

        have at least READ permission.


        Users must have the ``MANAGE`` permission to invoke this API.


        Example request:


        .. code::


        { "scope": "my-secret-scope", "principal": "data-scientists",
        "permission": "READ" }


        The principal is a user or group name corresponding to an existing
        Databricks principal to be granted

        or revoked access.


        Throws ``RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST`` if no such secret scope exists.
        Throws ``RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS``

        if a permission for the principal already exists. Throws
        ``INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE`` if the permission

        or principal is invalid. Throws ``PERMISSION_DENIED`` if the user does
        not have permission to make

        this API call.

        If `path` already exists and `overwrite` is set to `false`, this call
        returns an error

        `RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS`. To import a directory, you can use either the
        `DBC` format or the `SOURCE`

        format with the `language` field unset. To import a single file as
        `SOURCE`, you must set the

        `language` field. Zip files within directories are not supported.


        :param path: str
          The absolute path of the object or directory. Importing a directory is only supported for the `DBC`
          and `SOURCE` formats.
        :param content: str (optional)
          The base64-encoded content. This has a limit of 10 MB.

          If the limit (10MB) is exceeded, exception with error code **MAX_NOTEBOOK_SIZE_EXCEEDED** is thrown.
          This parameter might be absent, and instead a posted file is used.

          This specifies the format of the file to be imported.

          The value is case sensitive.

          - `AUTO`: The item is imported depending on an analysis of the item's extension and the header
          content provided in the request. If the item is imported as a notebook, then the item's extension is
          automatically removed. - `SOURCE`: The notebook or directory is imported as source code. - `HTML`:
          The notebook is imported as an HTML file. - `JUPYTER`: The notebook is imported as a Jupyter/IPython
          Notebook file. - `DBC`: The notebook is imported in Databricks archive format. Required for
          directories. - `R_MARKDOWN`: The notebook is imported from R Markdown format.
        :param language: :class:`Language` (optional)
          The language of the object. This value is set only if the object type is `NOTEBOOK`.
        :param overwrite: bool (optional)
          The flag that specifies whether to overwrite existing object. It is `false` by default. For `DBC`
          format, `overwrite` is not supported since it may contain a directory.
