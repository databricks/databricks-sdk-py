        Access them by:

        - attribute access:

          >>> Color.RED
          <Color.RED: 1>

        - value lookup:

          >>> Color(1)
          <Color.RED: 1>

        - name lookup:

          >>> Color['RED']
          <Color.RED: 1>

        Enumerations can be iterated over, and know how many members they have:

        >>> len(Color)
        3

        >>> list(Color)
        [<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.BLUE: 2>, <Color.GREEN: 3>]

        Methods can be added to enumerations, and members can have their own
        attributes -- see the documentation for details.
