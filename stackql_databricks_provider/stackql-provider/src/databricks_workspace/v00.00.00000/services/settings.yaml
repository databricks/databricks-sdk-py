        :param etag: str (optional)
          etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag provided. This is used for
          optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous writes of a setting overwriting
          each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read -> delete pattern
          to perform setting deletions in order to avoid race conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET
          request, and pass it with the DELETE request to identify the rule set version you are deleting.

        :param allow_missing: bool
          This should always be set to true for Settings API. Added for AIP compliance.
        :param setting: :class:`AibiDashboardEmbeddingAccessPolicySetting`

        :param field_mask: str
          The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
          field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
          `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.

        Updates the automatic cluster update setting for the workspace. A fresh
        etag needs to be provided in

        `PATCH` requests (as part of the setting field). The etag can be
        retrieved by making a `GET` request

        before the `PATCH` request. If the setting is updated concurrently,
        `PATCH` fails with 409 and the

        request must be retried by using the fresh etag in the 409 response.


        :param allow_missing: bool
          This should always be set to true for Settings API. Added for AIP compliance.
        :param setting: :class:`AutomaticClusterUpdateSetting`

        :param field_mask: str
          The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
          field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
          `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.

        :param field_mask: str
          The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
          field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
          `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.

        Updates the Default Warehouse Id setting.

          This should always be set to true for Settings API. Added for AIP compliance.
        :param setting: :class:`DefaultWarehouseId`
        :param field_mask: str
          The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
          field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
          `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.

          The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
          field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
          `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.

        :param field_mask: str
          The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
          field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
          `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.

        Creates an IP access list for this workspace.


        A list can be an allow list or a block list. See the top of this file
        for a description of how the

        server treats allow lists and block lists at runtime.


        When creating or updating an IP access list:


        * For all allow lists and block lists combined, the API supports a
        maximum of 1000 IP/CIDR values,

        where one CIDR counts as a single value. Attempts to exceed that number
        return error 400 with

        `error_code` value `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`. * If the new list would block the
        calling user's current IP,

        error 400 is returned with `error_code` value `INVALID_STATE`.


        It can take a few minutes for the changes to take effect. **Note**: Your
        new IP access list has no

        effect until you enable the feature. See :method:workspaceconf/setStatus

          etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag provided. This is used for
          optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous writes of a setting overwriting
          each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read -> delete pattern
          to perform setting deletions in order to avoid race conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET

        Updates the enable partner powered AI features account setting.

        :param allow_missing: bool

        :param setting: :class:`LlmProxyPartnerPoweredAccount`
        :param field_mask: str
          The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
          field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
          `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.

        Updates the restrict workspace admins setting for the workspace. A fresh
        etag needs to be provided in

        `PATCH` requests (as part of the setting field). The etag can be
        retrieved by making a GET request

        before the `PATCH` request. If the setting is updated concurrently,
        `PATCH` fails with 409 and the

        request must be retried by using the fresh etag in the 409 response.


        :param allow_missing: bool
          This should always be set to true for Settings API. Added for AIP compliance.
        :param setting: :class:`RestrictWorkspaceAdminsSetting`

        :param field_mask: str
          The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
          field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
          `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.
