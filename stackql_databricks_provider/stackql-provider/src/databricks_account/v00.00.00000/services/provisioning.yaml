        Creates a Databricks credential configuration that represents cloud
        cross-account credentials for a

        specified account. Databricks uses this to set up network infrastructure
        properly to host Databricks

        clusters. For your AWS IAM role, you need to trust the External ID (the
        Databricks Account API account

        ID) in the returned credential object, and configure the required access
        policy.


        Save the response's `credentials_id` field, which is the ID for your new
        credential configuration

        object.

        Creates a customer-managed key configuration object for an account,

        uploads a reference to a customer-managed key to Databricks. If the key
        is assigned as a workspace's

        customer-managed key for managed services, Databricks uses the key to
        encrypt the workspaces notebooks

        and secrets in the control plane, in addition to Databricks SQL queries
        and query history. If it is

        specified as a workspace's customer-managed key for workspace storage,
        the key encrypts the

        workspace's root S3 bucket (which contains the workspace's root DBFS and
        system data) and, optionally,

        cluster EBS volume data.


        **Important**: Customer-managed keys are supported only for some
        deployment types, subscription types,

        and AWS regions that currently support creation of Databricks
        workspaces.


        This operation is available only if your account is on the E2 version of
        the platform or on a select

        custom plan that allows multiple workspaces per account.

        :param allowed_vpc_endpoint_ids: List[str] (optional)
          An array of Databricks VPC endpoint IDs. This is the Databricks ID returned when registering the VPC
          endpoint configuration in your Databricks account. This is not the ID of the VPC endpoint in AWS.
          Only used when private_access_level is set to ENDPOINT. This is an allow list of VPC endpoints
          registered in your Databricks account that can connect to your workspace over AWS PrivateLink. Note:

          The private access level controls which VPC endpoints can connect to the UI or API of any workspace
          that attaches this private access settings object. `ACCOUNT` level access (the default) allows only
          VPC endpoints that are registered in your Databricks account connect to your workspace. `ENDPOINT`
          level access allows only specified VPC endpoints connect to your workspace. For details, see
          allowed_vpc_endpoint_ids.
        :param private_access_settings_name: str (optional)
          The human-readable name of the private access settings object.
        :param public_access_enabled: bool (optional)
          Determines if the workspace can be accessed over public internet. For fully private workspaces, you
          can optionally specify false, but only if you implement both the front-end and the back-end
          PrivateLink connections. Otherwise, specify true, which means that public access is enabled.

        Updates an existing private access settings object, which specifies how
        your workspace is accessed

        over AWS PrivateLink. To use AWS PrivateLink, a workspace must have a
        private access settings object

        referenced by ID in the workspace's private_access_settings_id property.
        This operation completely

        overwrites your existing private access settings object attached to your
        workspaces. All workspaces

        attached to the private access settings are affected by any change. If
        public_access_enabled,

        private_access_level, or allowed_vpc_endpoint_ids are updated, effects
        of these changes might take

        several minutes to propagate to the workspace API. You can share one
        private access settings object

        with multiple workspaces in a single account. However, private access
        settings are specific to AWS

        regions, so only workspaces in the same AWS region can use a given
        private access settings object.

        Before configuring PrivateLink, read the Databricks article about
        PrivateLink.

        Creates a new workspace using a credential configuration and a storage

        network configuration (if using a customer-managed VPC), an optional

        an optional storage key

        services and storage encryption can be the same or different.


        Important: This operation is asynchronous. A response with HTTP status
        code 200 means the request has

        been accepted and is in progress, but does not mean that the workspace
        deployed successfully and is

        running. The initial workspace status is typically PROVISIONING. Use the
        workspace ID (workspace_id)

        field in the response to identify the new workspace and make repeated
        GET requests with the workspace

        ID and check its status. The workspace becomes available when the status
        changes to RUNNING.


        You can share one customer-managed VPC with multiple workspaces in a
        single account. It is not

        required to create a new VPC for each workspace. However, you cannot
        reuse subnets or Security Groups

        between workspaces. If you plan to share one VPC with multiple
        workspaces, make sure you size your VPC

        and subnets accordingly. Because a Databricks Account API network
        configuration encapsulates this

        information, you cannot reuse a Databricks Account API network
        configuration across workspaces.


        For information about how to create a new workspace with this API
        including error handling, see

        [Create a new workspace using the Account API].


        Important: Customer-managed VPCs, PrivateLink, and customer-managed keys
        are supported on a limited

        set of deployment and subscription types. If you have questions about
        availability, contact your

        Databricks representative.


        This operation is available only if your account is on the E2 version of
        the platform or on a select

        custom plan that allows multiple workspaces per account.

          experience. This means you don't need to provide any resources managed by you, such as credentials,
          storage, or network. If the compute mode is `HYBRID` (which is the default option), a classic
          workspace is created that uses customer-managed resources.

          The custom tags key-value pairing that is attached to this workspace. The key-value pair is a string
          of utf-8 characters. The value can be an empty string, with maximum length of 255 characters. The
          key can be of maximum length of 127 characters, and cannot be empty.

          application and REST APIs is <workspace-deployment-name>.cloud.databricks.com. For example, if the
          deployment name is abcsales, your workspace URL will be https://abcsales.cloud.databricks.com.
          Hyphens are allowed. This property supports only the set of characters that are allowed in a
          subdomain. To set this value, you must have a deployment name prefix. Contact your Databricks
          account team to add an account deployment name prefix to your account. Workspace deployment names
          follow the account prefix and a hyphen. For example, if your account's deployment prefix is acme and
          the workspace deployment name is workspace-1, the JSON response for the deployment_name field
          becomes acme-workspace-1. The workspace URL would be acme-workspace-1.cloud.databricks.com. You can
          also set the deployment_name to the reserved keyword EMPTY if you want the deployment name to only
          include the deployment prefix. For example, if your account's deployment prefix is acme and the
          workspace deployment name is EMPTY, the deployment_name becomes acme only and the workspace URL is
          acme.cloud.databricks.com. This value must be unique across all non-deleted deployments across all
          AWS regions. If a new workspace omits this property, the server generates a unique deployment name
          for you with the pattern dbc-xxxxxxxx-xxxx.

          history. The provided key configuration object property use_cases must contain MANAGED_SERVICES.
        :param network_connectivity_config_id: str (optional)
          The object ID of network connectivity config. Once assigned, the workspace serverless compute
          resources use the same set of stable IP CIDR blocks and optional private link to access your
          resources.

        :param private_access_settings_id: str (optional)
          ID of the workspace's private access settings object. Only used for PrivateLink. You must specify
          this ID if you are using [AWS PrivateLink] for either front-end (user-to-workspace connection),
          back-end (data plane to control plane connection), or both connection types. Before configuring
          PrivateLink, read the [Databricks article about PrivateLink].",

          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. It’s recommended to always explicitly list the

                    field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the

                    can lead to unintended results if the API changes in the
