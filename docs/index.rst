Databricks SDK for Python (Beta)
--------------------------------

The Databricks SDK for Python includes functionality to accelerate development with Python for the Databricks Lakehouse.
It covers all public `Databricks REST API <https://docs.databricks.com/api>`_ operations.

This SDK is supported for production use cases, but we do expect future releases to have `some interface changes <https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-py#interface-stability>`_.
We are keen to hear feedback from you on these SDKs. Please `file GitHub issues <https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-py/issues>`_, and we will address them.
