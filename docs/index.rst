Databricks SDK for Python
-------------------------

The Databricks SDK for Python includes functionality to accelerate development with Python for the Databricks Lakehouse.
It covers all public `Databricks REST API <https://docs.databricks.com/api>`_ operations.
The SDK's internal HTTP client is robust and handles failures on different levels by
performing intelligent retries. Install it via

.. code-block::

  $ pip install databricks-sdk

.. note::

   The Databricks SDK for Python is in an Experimental state. To provide feedback, ask questions, and report issues, use the `Issues tab <https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-py/issues>`_ in the `Databricks SDK for Python repository <https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-py>`_ on GitHub.

   During the Experimental period, Databricks is actively working on stabilizing the Databricks SDK for Pythonâ€™s interfaces. API clients for all services are generated from specification files that are synchronized from the main platform. You are highly encouraged to install a specific version of the Databricks SDK for Python package and read the changelog where Databricks documents the changes. Databricks may have minor documented backward-incompatible changes, such as renaming the functions or some class names to bring more consistency.
