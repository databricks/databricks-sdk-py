``a.settings.esm_enablement_account``: Enhanced Security Monitoring For New Workspaces
======================================================================================
.. currentmodule:: databricks.sdk.service.settings

.. py:class:: EsmEnablementAccountAPI

    The enhanced security monitoring setting at the account level controls whether to enable the feature on
    new workspaces. By default, this account-level setting is disabled for new workspaces. After workspace
    creation, account admins can enable enhanced security monitoring individually for each workspace.

    .. py:method:: get( [, etag: Optional[str]]) -> EsmEnablementAccountSetting

        Get the enhanced security monitoring setting for new workspaces.
        
        Gets the enhanced security monitoring setting for new workspaces.
        
        :param etag: str (optional)
          etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag provided. This is used for
          optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous writes of a setting overwriting
          each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read -> delete pattern
          to perform setting deletions in order to avoid race conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET
          request, and pass it with the DELETE request to identify the rule set version you are deleting.
        
        :returns: :class:`EsmEnablementAccountSetting`
        

    .. py:method:: update(allow_missing: bool, setting: EsmEnablementAccountSetting, field_mask: str) -> EsmEnablementAccountSetting

        Update the enhanced security monitoring setting for new workspaces.
        
        Updates the value of the enhanced security monitoring setting for new workspaces.
        
        :param allow_missing: bool
          This should always be set to true for Settings API. Added for AIP compliance.
        :param setting: :class:`EsmEnablementAccountSetting`
        :param field_mask: str
          Field mask is required to be passed into the PATCH request. Field mask specifies which fields of the
          setting payload will be updated. The field mask needs to be supplied as single string. To specify
          multiple fields in the field mask, use comma as the separator (no space).
