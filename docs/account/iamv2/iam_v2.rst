``a.iam_v2``: account_iam.v2
============================
.. currentmodule:: databricks.sdk.service.iamv2

.. py:class:: AccountIamV2API

    These APIs are used to manage identities and the workspace access of these identities in <Databricks>.

    .. py:method:: create_workspace_assignment_detail(workspace_id: int, workspace_assignment_detail: WorkspaceAssignmentDetail) -> WorkspaceAssignmentDetail

        Creates a workspace assignment detail for a principal. Entitlement grants are applied individually and
        non-atomically — if a failure occurs partway through, the principal will be assigned to the
        workspace but with only a subset of the requested entitlements. Use GetWorkspaceAssignmentDetail to
        confirm which entitlements were successfully granted.

        :param workspace_id: int
          Required. The workspace ID for which the workspace assignment detail is being created.
        :param workspace_assignment_detail: :class:`WorkspaceAssignmentDetail`
          Required. Workspace assignment detail to be created in <Databricks>.

        :returns: :class:`WorkspaceAssignmentDetail`
        

    .. py:method:: delete_workspace_assignment_detail(workspace_id: int, principal_id: int)

        Deletes a workspace assignment detail for a principal, revoking all associated entitlements.
        Entitlement revocations are applied individually and non-atomically — if a failure occurs partway
        through, the principal remains assigned with a subset of its original entitlements, and the operation
        is safe to retry.

        :param workspace_id: int
          The workspace ID where the principal has access.
        :param principal_id: int
          Required. ID of the principal in Databricks to delete workspace assignment for.


        

    .. py:method:: get_workspace_access_detail(workspace_id: int, principal_id: int [, view: Optional[WorkspaceAccessDetailView]]) -> WorkspaceAccessDetail

        Returns the access details for a principal in a workspace. Allows for checking access details for any
        provisioned principal (user, service principal, or group) in a workspace. * Provisioned principal here
        refers to one that has been synced into Databricks from the customer's IdP or added explicitly to
        Databricks via SCIM/UI. Allows for passing in a "view" parameter to control what fields are returned
        (BASIC by default or FULL).

        :param workspace_id: int
          Required. The workspace ID for which the access details are being requested.
        :param principal_id: int
          Required. The internal ID of the principal (user/sp/group) for which the access details are being
          requested.
        :param view: :class:`WorkspaceAccessDetailView` (optional)
          Controls what fields are returned.

        :returns: :class:`WorkspaceAccessDetail`
        

    .. py:method:: get_workspace_assignment_detail(workspace_id: int, principal_id: int) -> WorkspaceAssignmentDetail

        Returns the assignment details for a principal in a workspace.

        :param workspace_id: int
          Required. The workspace ID for which the assignment details are being requested.
        :param principal_id: int
          Required. The internal ID of the principal (user/sp/group) for which the assignment details are
          being requested.

        :returns: :class:`WorkspaceAssignmentDetail`
        

    .. py:method:: list_workspace_assignment_details(workspace_id: int [, page_size: Optional[int], page_token: Optional[str]]) -> ListWorkspaceAssignmentDetailsResponse

        Lists workspace assignment details for a workspace.

        :param workspace_id: int
          Required. The workspace ID for which the workspace assignment details are being fetched.
        :param page_size: int (optional)
          The maximum number of workspace assignment details to return. The service may return fewer than this
          value.
        :param page_token: str (optional)
          A page token, received from a previous ListWorkspaceAssignmentDetails call. Provide this to retrieve
          the subsequent page.

        :returns: :class:`ListWorkspaceAssignmentDetailsResponse`
        

    .. py:method:: resolve_group(external_id: str) -> ResolveGroupResponse

        Resolves a group with the given external ID from the customer's IdP. If the group does not exist, it
        will be created in the account. If the customer is not onboarded onto Automatic Identity Management
        (AIM), this will return an error.

        :param external_id: str
          Required. The external ID of the group in the customer's IdP.

        :returns: :class:`ResolveGroupResponse`
        

    .. py:method:: resolve_service_principal(external_id: str) -> ResolveServicePrincipalResponse

        Resolves an SP with the given external ID from the customer's IdP. If the SP does not exist, it will
        be created. If the customer is not onboarded onto Automatic Identity Management (AIM), this will
        return an error.

        :param external_id: str
          Required. The external ID of the service principal in the customer's IdP.

        :returns: :class:`ResolveServicePrincipalResponse`
        

    .. py:method:: resolve_user(external_id: str) -> ResolveUserResponse

        Resolves a user with the given external ID from the customer's IdP. If the user does not exist, it
        will be created. If the customer is not onboarded onto Automatic Identity Management (AIM), this will
        return an error.

        :param external_id: str
          Required. The external ID of the user in the customer's IdP.

        :returns: :class:`ResolveUserResponse`
        

    .. py:method:: update_workspace_assignment_detail(workspace_id: int, principal_id: int, workspace_assignment_detail: WorkspaceAssignmentDetail, update_mask: FieldMask) -> WorkspaceAssignmentDetail

        Updates the entitlements of a directly assigned principal in a workspace. Entitlement changes are
        applied individually and non-atomically — if a failure occurs partway through, only a subset of the
        requested changes may have been applied. Use GetWorkspaceAssignmentDetail to confirm the final state.

        :param workspace_id: int
          Required. The workspace ID for which the workspace assignment detail is being updated.
        :param principal_id: int
          Required. ID of the principal in Databricks.
        :param workspace_assignment_detail: :class:`WorkspaceAssignmentDetail`
          Required. Workspace assignment detail to be updated in <Databricks>.
        :param update_mask: FieldMask
          Required. The list of fields to update.

        :returns: :class:`WorkspaceAssignmentDetail`
