``w.dashboards``: Dashboards
============================
.. currentmodule:: databricks.sdk.service.sql

.. py:class:: DashboardsAPI

    In general, there is little need to modify dashboards using the API. However, it can be useful to use
    dashboard objects to look-up a collection of related query IDs. The API can also be used to duplicate
    multiple dashboards at once since you can get a dashboard definition with a GET request and then POST it
    to create a new one. Dashboards can be scheduled using the `sql_task` type of the Jobs API, e.g.
    :method:jobs/create.
