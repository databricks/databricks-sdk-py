Catalogs

.. py:class:: CatalogsAPI

    A catalog is the first layer of Unity Catalog’s three-level namespace. It’s used to organize your data
    assets. Users can see all catalogs on which they have been assigned the USE_CATALOG data permission.
    
    In Unity Catalog, admins and data stewards manage users and their access to data centrally across all of
    the workspaces in a Databricks account. Users in different workspaces can share access to the same data,
    depending on privileges granted centrally in Unity Catalog.
