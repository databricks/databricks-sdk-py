    A clean room is a secure, privacy-protecting environment where two or more parties can share sensitive
    enterprise data, including customer data, for measurements, insights, activation and other use cases.
    
    To create clean rooms, you must be a metastore admin or a user with the **CREATE_CLEAN_ROOM** privilege.

    .. py:method:: create(name: str, remote_detailed_info: CentralCleanRoomInfo [, comment: Optional[str]]) -> CleanRoomInfo

        Create a clean room.
        
        Creates a new clean room with specified colaborators. The caller must be a metastore admin or have the
        **CREATE_CLEAN_ROOM** privilege on the metastore.
        
        :param name: str
          Name of the clean room.
        :param remote_detailed_info: :class:`CentralCleanRoomInfo`

    .. py:method:: delete(name_arg: str)

        Delete a clean room.
        
        Deletes a data object clean room from the metastore. The caller must be an owner of the clean room.
        
        :param name_arg: str
          The name of the clean room.
        
        
        

    .. py:method:: get(name_arg: str [, include_remote_details: Optional[bool]]) -> CleanRoomInfo

        the clean room.
        
        :param name_arg: str
          The name of the clean room.
        :param include_remote_details: bool (optional)
          Whether to include remote details (central) on the clean room.
        
        :returns: :class:`CleanRoomInfo`
        

    .. py:method:: list( [, max_results: Optional[int], page_token: Optional[str]]) -> Iterator[CleanRoomInfo]

        List clean rooms.
        
        Gets an array of data object clean rooms from the metastore. The caller must be a metastore admin or
        the owner of the clean room. There is no guarantee of a specific ordering of the elements in the
        array.
        
        :param max_results: int (optional)
          Maximum number of clean rooms to return. If not set, all the clean rooms are returned (not
          recommended). - when set to a value greater than 0, the page length is the minimum of this value and
          a server configured value; - when set to 0, the page length is set to a server configured value
          (recommended); - when set to a value less than 0, an invalid parameter error is returned;
        :param page_token: str (optional)
          Opaque pagination token to go to next page based on previous query.
        
        :returns: Iterator over :class:`CleanRoomInfo`
        

    .. py:method:: update(name_arg: str [, catalog_updates: Optional[List[CleanRoomCatalogUpdate]], comment: Optional[str], owner: Optional[str]]) -> CleanRoomInfo

        Update a clean room.
        
        Updates the clean room with the changes and data objects in the request. The caller must be the owner
        of the clean room or a metastore admin.
        
        When the caller is a metastore admin, only the __owner__ field can be updated.
        
        In the case that the clean room name is changed **updateCleanRoom** requires that the caller is both
        the clean room owner and a metastore admin.
        
        For each table that is added through this method, the clean room owner must also have **SELECT**
        privilege on the table. The privilege must be maintained indefinitely for recipients to be able to
        access the table. Typically, you should use a group as the clean room owner.
        
        Table removals through **update** do not require additional privileges.
        
        :param name_arg: str
          The name of the clean room.
        :param catalog_updates: List[:class:`CleanRoomCatalogUpdate`] (optional)

          User-provided free-form text description.
