``w.workspace``: Workspace
==========================
.. currentmodule:: databricks.sdk.service.workspace

.. py:class:: WorkspaceExt

    The Workspace API allows you to list, import, export, and delete notebooks and folders.
    
    A notebook is a web-based interface to a document that contains runnable code, visualizations, and
    explanatory text.

    .. py:method:: delete(path: str [, recursive: Optional[bool]])

        Delete a workspace object.
        
        Deletes an object or a directory (and optionally recursively deletes all objects in the directory). *
        If `path` does not exist, this call returns an error `RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST`. * If `path` is a
        non-empty directory and `recursive` is set to `false`, this call returns an error
        `DIRECTORY_NOT_EMPTY`.
        
        Object deletion cannot be undone and deleting a directory recursively is not atomic.
        
        :param path: str
          The absolute path of the notebook or directory.
        :param recursive: bool (optional)
          The flag that specifies whether to delete the object recursively. It is `false` by default. Please
          note this deleting directory is not atomic. If it fails in the middle, some of objects under this
          directory may be deleted and cannot be undone.
        
        
        

    .. py:method:: download(path: str [, format: ExportFormat]) -> BinaryIO


        Usage:

        .. code-block::

            import io
            import time
            
            from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
            from databricks.sdk.service.workspace import ImportFormat
            
            w = WorkspaceClient()
            
            py_file = f'/Users/{w.current_user.me().user_name}/file-{time.time_ns()}.py'
            
            w.workspace.upload(py_file, io.BytesIO(b'print(1)'), format=ImportFormat.AUTO)
            with w.workspace.download(py_file) as f:
                content = f.read()
                assert content == b'print(1)'
            
            w.workspace.delete(py_file)

        
        Downloads notebook or file from the workspace

        :param path:     location of the file or notebook on workspace.
        :param format:   By default, `ExportFormat.SOURCE`. If using `ExportFormat.AUTO` the `path`
                         is imported or exported as either a workspace file or a notebook, depending
                         on an analysis of the `item`â€™s extension and the header content provided in
                         the request.
        :return:         file-like `io.BinaryIO` of the `path` contents.
        

    .. py:method:: export(path: str [, format: Optional[ExportFormat]]) -> ExportResponse


        Usage:

        .. code-block::

            import time
            
            from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
            from databricks.sdk.service import workspace
            
            w = WorkspaceClient()
            
            notebook = f'/Users/{w.current_user.me().user_name}/sdk-{time.time_ns()}'
            
            export_response = w.workspace.export(format=workspace.ExportFormat.SOURCE, path=notebook)

        Export a workspace object.
        
        Exports an object or the contents of an entire directory.
        
        If `path` does not exist, this call returns an error `RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST`.
        
        If the exported data would exceed size limit, this call returns `MAX_NOTEBOOK_SIZE_EXCEEDED`.
        Currently, this API does not support exporting a library.
        
        :param path: str
          The absolute path of the object or directory. Exporting a directory is only supported for the `DBC`,
          `SOURCE`, and `AUTO` format.
        :param format: :class:`ExportFormat` (optional)
          This specifies the format of the exported file. By default, this is `SOURCE`.
          
          The value is case sensitive.
          
          - `SOURCE`: The notebook is exported as source code. Directory exports will not include non-notebook
          entries. - `HTML`: The notebook is exported as an HTML file. - `JUPYTER`: The notebook is exported
          as a Jupyter/IPython Notebook file. - `DBC`: The notebook is exported in Databricks archive format.
          Directory exports will not include non-notebook entries. - `R_MARKDOWN`: The notebook is exported to
          R Markdown format. - `AUTO`: The object or directory is exported depending on the objects type.
          Directory exports will include notebooks and workspace files.
        
        :returns: :class:`ExportResponse`

    .. py:method:: get_status(path: str) -> ObjectInfo


        Usage:

        .. code-block::

            import time
            
            from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
            
            w = WorkspaceClient()

    .. py:method:: import_(path: str [, content: Optional[str], format: Optional[ImportFormat], language: Optional[Language], overwrite: Optional[bool]])


        Usage:

        .. code-block::

            import base64
            import time
            
            from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
            from databricks.sdk.service import workspace
            
            w = WorkspaceClient()
            
            notebook_path = f'/Users/{w.current_user.me().user_name}/sdk-{time.time_ns()}'
            
            w.workspace.import_(content=base64.b64encode(("CREATE LIVE TABLE dlt_sample AS SELECT 1").encode()).decode(),
                                format=workspace.ImportFormat.SOURCE,
                                language=workspace.Language.SQL,
                                overwrite=True,
                                path=notebook_path)

        Import a workspace object.
        
        Imports a workspace object (for example, a notebook or file) or the contents of an entire directory.
        If `path` already exists and `overwrite` is set to `false`, this call returns an error
        `RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS`. To import a directory, you can use either the `DBC` format or the `SOURCE`
        format with the `language` field unset. To import a single file as `SOURCE`, you must set the
        `language` field.
        
        :param path: str
          The absolute path of the object or directory. Importing a directory is only supported for the `DBC`
          and `SOURCE` formats.
        :param content: str (optional)
          The base64-encoded content. This has a limit of 10 MB.
          
          If the limit (10MB) is exceeded, exception with error code **MAX_NOTEBOOK_SIZE_EXCEEDED** is thrown.
          This parameter might be absent, and instead a posted file is used.
        :param format: :class:`ImportFormat` (optional)
          This specifies the format of the file to be imported.
          
          The value is case sensitive.
          
          - `AUTO`: The item is imported depending on an analysis of the item's extension and the header
          content provided in the request. If the item is imported as a notebook, then the item's extension is
          automatically removed. - `SOURCE`: The notebook or directory is imported as source code. - `HTML`:
          The notebook is imported as an HTML file. - `JUPYTER`: The notebook is imported as a Jupyter/IPython
          Notebook file. - `DBC`: The notebook is imported in Databricks archive format. Required for
          directories. - `R_MARKDOWN`: The notebook is imported from R Markdown format.
        :param language: :class:`Language` (optional)
          The language of the object. This value is set only if the object type is `NOTEBOOK`.
        :param overwrite: bool (optional)
          The flag that specifies whether to overwrite existing object. It is `false` by default. For `DBC`
          format, `overwrite` is not supported since it may contain a directory.
        
        
        

    .. py:method:: list(path: str [, notebooks_modified_after: int, recursive: bool = False]) -> ObjectInfo


        Usage:

        .. code-block::

            from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
            
            w = WorkspaceClient()
            
            names = []
            for i in w.workspace.list(f'/Users/{w.current_user.me().user_name}', recursive=True):
                names.append(i.path)
            assert len(names) > 0

        List workspace objects

        :param recursive: bool
            Optionally invoke recursive traversal

        :returns: Iterator of workspaceObjectInfo
        

    .. py:method:: mkdirs(path: str)

        Create a directory.
        
        Creates the specified directory (and necessary parent directories if they do not exist). If there is
        an object (not a directory) at any prefix of the input path, this call returns an error
        `RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS`.
        
        Note that if this operation fails it may have succeeded in creating some of the necessary parent
        directories.
        
        :param path: str
          The absolute path of the directory. If the parent directories do not exist, it will also create
          them. If the directory already exists, this command will do nothing and succeed.
        
        
        

    .. py:method:: set_permissions(workspace_object_type: str, workspace_object_id: str [, access_control_list: Optional[List[WorkspaceObjectAccessControlRequest]]]) -> WorkspaceObjectPermissions

        Set workspace object permissions.
        
        Sets permissions on a workspace object. Workspace objects can inherit permissions from their parent
        objects or root object.
        
        :param workspace_object_type: str
          The workspace object type for which to get or manage permissions.
        :param workspace_object_id: str
          The workspace object for which to get or manage permissions.
        :param access_control_list: List[:class:`WorkspaceObjectAccessControlRequest`] (optional)
        
        :returns: :class:`WorkspaceObjectPermissions`
        

    .. py:method:: update_permissions(workspace_object_type: str, workspace_object_id: str [, access_control_list: Optional[List[WorkspaceObjectAccessControlRequest]]]) -> WorkspaceObjectPermissions

        Update workspace object permissions.
        
        Updates the permissions on a workspace object. Workspace objects can inherit permissions from their
        parent objects or root object.
        
        :param workspace_object_type: str
          The workspace object type for which to get or manage permissions.
        :param workspace_object_id: str

        :param access_control_list: List[:class:`WorkspaceObjectAccessControlRequest`] (optional)
        
        :returns: :class:`WorkspaceObjectPermissions`
        

    .. py:method:: upload(path: str, content: bytes [, format: ImportFormat, language: Language, overwrite: bool = False])


        Usage:

        .. code-block::

            import io
            import time
            
            from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
            
            w = WorkspaceClient()
            
            notebook = f'/Users/{w.current_user.me().user_name}/notebook-{time.time_ns()}.py'
            
            w.workspace.upload(notebook, io.BytesIO(b'print(1)'))
            with w.workspace.download(notebook) as f:
                content = f.read()
                assert content == b'# Databricks notebook source\nprint(1)'
            
            w.workspace.delete(notebook)

        
        Uploads a workspace object (for example, a notebook or file) or the contents of an entire
        directory (`DBC` format).

        Errors:
         * `RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS`: if `path` already exists no `overwrite=True`.
         * `INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE`: if `format` and `content` values are not compatible.

        :param path:     target location of the file on workspace.
        :param content:  the contents as either raw binary data `bytes` or a file-like the file-like `io.BinaryIO` of the `path` contents.
        :param format:   By default, `ImportFormat.SOURCE`. If using `ImportFormat.AUTO` the `path`
                         is imported or exported as either a workspace file or a notebook, depending
                         on an analysis of the `item`â€™s extension and the header content provided in
                         the request. In addition, if the `path` is imported as a notebook, then
                         the `item`â€™s extension is automatically removed.
        :param language: Only required if using `ExportFormat.SOURCE`.
