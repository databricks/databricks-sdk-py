``w.settings``: Default Namespace
=================================
.. currentmodule:: databricks.sdk.service.settings

.. py:class:: SettingsAPI

    The default namespace setting API allows users to configure the default namespace for a Databricks
    workspace.
    
    Through this API, users can retrieve, set, or modify the default namespace used when queries do not
    reference a fully qualified three-level name. For example, if you use the API to set 'retail_prod' as the
    default catalog, then a query 'SELECT * FROM myTable' would reference the object
    'retail_prod.default.myTable' (the schema 'default' is always assumed).
    
    This setting requires a restart of clusters and SQL warehouses to take effect. Additionally, the default
    namespace only applies when using Unity Catalog-enabled compute.

    .. py:method:: delete_default_workspace_namespace(etag: str) -> DeleteDefaultWorkspaceNamespaceResponse

        Delete the default namespace setting.
        
        Deletes the default namespace setting for the workspace. A fresh etag needs to be provided in DELETE
        requests (as a query parameter). The etag can be retrieved by making a GET request before the DELETE
        request. If the setting is updated/deleted concurrently, DELETE will fail with 409 and the request
        will need to be retried by using the fresh etag in the 409 response.
        
        :param etag: str
          etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag provided. This is used for
          optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous writes of a setting overwriting
          each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read -> delete pattern
          to perform setting deletions in order to avoid race conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET
          request, and pass it with the DELETE request to identify the rule set version you are deleting.
        
        :returns: :class:`DeleteDefaultWorkspaceNamespaceResponse`
        

    .. py:method:: read_default_workspace_namespace(etag: str) -> DefaultNamespaceSetting

        Get the default namespace setting.
        
        Gets the default namespace setting.
        
        :param etag: str
          etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag provided. This is used for
          optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous writes of a setting overwriting
          each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read -> delete pattern
          to perform setting deletions in order to avoid race conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET
          request, and pass it with the DELETE request to identify the rule set version you are deleting.
        
        :returns: :class:`DefaultNamespaceSetting`
        

    .. py:method:: update_default_workspace_namespace( [, allow_missing: Optional[bool], field_mask: Optional[str], setting: Optional[DefaultNamespaceSetting]]) -> DefaultNamespaceSetting

        Update the default namespace setting.
        
        Updates the default namespace setting for the workspace. A fresh etag needs to be provided in PATCH
        requests (as part of the setting field). The etag can be retrieved by making a GET request before the
        PATCH request. Note that if the setting does not exist, GET will return a NOT_FOUND error and the etag
        will be present in the error response, which should be set in the PATCH request. If the setting is
        updated concurrently, PATCH will fail with 409 and the request will need to be retried by using the
        fresh etag in the 409 response.
        
        :param allow_missing: bool (optional)
          This should always be set to true for Settings API. Added for AIP compliance.
        :param field_mask: str (optional)
          Field mask is required to be passed into the PATCH request. Field mask specifies which fields of the
          setting payload will be updated. For example, for Default Namespace setting, the field mask is
          supposed to contain fields from the DefaultNamespaceSetting.namespace schema.
          
          The field mask needs to be supplied as single string. To specify multiple fields in the field mask,
          use comma as the seperator (no space).
        :param setting: :class:`DefaultNamespaceSetting` (optional)
          This represents the setting configuration for the default namespace in the Databricks workspace.
          Setting the default catalog for the workspace determines the catalog that is used when queries do
          not reference a fully qualified 3 level name. For example, if the default catalog is set to
          'retail_prod' then a query 'SELECT * FROM myTable' would reference the object
          'retail_prod.default.myTable' (the schema 'default' is always assumed). This setting requires a
          restart of clusters and SQL warehouses to take effect. Additionally, the default namespace only
          applies when using Unity Catalog-enabled compute.
