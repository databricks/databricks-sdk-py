``w.settings.disable_legacy_dbfs``: Disable Legacy DBFS
=======================================================
.. currentmodule:: databricks.sdk.service.settings

.. py:class:: DisableLegacyDbfsAPI

    When this setting is on, access to DBFS root and DBFS mounts is disallowed (as well as creation of new
mounts). When the setting is off, all DBFS functionality is enabled

    .. py:method:: delete( [, etag: Optional[str]]) -> DeleteDisableLegacyDbfsResponse

        Delete the disable legacy DBFS setting.

Deletes the disable legacy DBFS setting for a workspace, reverting back to the default.

:param etag: str (optional)
  etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag provided. This is used for
  optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous writes of a setting overwriting
  each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read -> delete pattern
  to perform setting deletions in order to avoid race conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET
  request, and pass it with the DELETE request to identify the rule set version you are deleting.

:returns: :class:`DeleteDisableLegacyDbfsResponse`


    .. py:method:: get( [, etag: Optional[str]]) -> DisableLegacyDbfs

        Get the disable legacy DBFS setting.

Gets the disable legacy DBFS setting.

    .. py:method:: update(allow_missing: bool, setting: DisableLegacyDbfs, field_mask: str) -> DisableLegacyDbfs

        Update the disable legacy DBFS setting.

Updates the disable legacy DBFS setting for the workspace.

:param allow_missing: bool
  This should always be set to true for Settings API. Added for AIP compliance.
:param setting: :class:`DisableLegacyDbfs`
:param field_mask: str
  The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
  field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
  `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
  the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
  names.
  
  A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. Itâ€™s recommended to always explicitly list the
  fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
  changes in the future.
