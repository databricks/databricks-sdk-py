``w.settings.default_namespace``: Default Namespace
===================================================
.. currentmodule:: databricks.sdk.service.settings

.. py:class:: DefaultNamespaceAPI

    The default namespace setting API allows users to configure the default namespace for a Databricks
    workspace.
    
    Through this API, users can retrieve, set, or modify the default namespace used when queries do not
    reference a fully qualified three-level name. For example, if you use the API to set 'retail_prod' as the
    default catalog, then a query 'SELECT * FROM myTable' would reference the object
    'retail_prod.default.myTable' (the schema 'default' is always assumed).
    
    This setting requires a restart of clusters and SQL warehouses to take effect. Additionally, the default
    namespace only applies when using Unity Catalog-enabled compute.

    .. py:method:: delete( [, etag: Optional[str]]) -> DeleteDefaultNamespaceSettingResponse

        Deletes the default namespace setting for the workspace. A fresh etag needs to be provided in `DELETE`
        requests (as a query parameter). The etag can be retrieved by making a `GET` request before the
        `DELETE` request. If the setting is updated/deleted concurrently, `DELETE` fails with 409 and the
        request must be retried by using the fresh etag in the 409 response.
        
        :param etag: str (optional)
          etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag provided. This is used for
          optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous writes of a setting overwriting
          each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read -> delete pattern
          to perform setting deletions in order to avoid race conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET
          request, and pass it with the DELETE request to identify the rule set version you are deleting.
        
        :returns: :class:`DeleteDefaultNamespaceSettingResponse`
        

    .. py:method:: get( [, etag: Optional[str]]) -> DefaultNamespaceSetting

        Gets the default namespace setting.
        
        :param etag: str (optional)
          etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag provided. This is used for
          optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous writes of a setting overwriting
          each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read -> delete pattern
          to perform setting deletions in order to avoid race conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET
          request, and pass it with the DELETE request to identify the rule set version you are deleting.
        
        :returns: :class:`DefaultNamespaceSetting`
        

    .. py:method:: update(allow_missing: bool, setting: DefaultNamespaceSetting, field_mask: str) -> DefaultNamespaceSetting

        Updates the default namespace setting for the workspace. A fresh etag needs to be provided in `PATCH`
        requests (as part of the setting field). The etag can be retrieved by making a `GET` request before
        the `PATCH` request. Note that if the setting does not exist, `GET` returns a NOT_FOUND error and the
        etag is present in the error response, which should be set in the `PATCH` request. If the setting is
        updated concurrently, `PATCH` fails with 409 and the request must be retried by using the fresh etag
        in the 409 response.
        
        :param allow_missing: bool
          This should always be set to true for Settings API. Added for AIP compliance.
        :param setting: :class:`DefaultNamespaceSetting`
        :param field_mask: str
          The field mask must be a single string, with multiple fields separated by commas (no spaces). The
          field path is relative to the resource object, using a dot (`.`) to navigate sub-fields (e.g.,
          `author.given_name`). Specification of elements in sequence or map fields is not allowed, as only
          the entire collection field can be specified. Field names must exactly match the resource field
          names.
          
          A field mask of `*` indicates full replacement. Itâ€™s recommended to always explicitly list the
          fields being updated and avoid using `*` wildcards, as it can lead to unintended results if the API
          changes in the future.
