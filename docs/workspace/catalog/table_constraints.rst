``w.table_constraints``: Table Constraints
==========================================
.. currentmodule:: databricks.sdk.service.catalog

.. py:class:: TableConstraintsAPI

    Primary key and foreign key constraints encode relationships between fields in tables.
    
    Primary and foreign keys are informational only and are not enforced. Foreign keys must reference a
    primary key in another table. This primary key is the parent constraint of the foreign key and the table
    this primary key is on is the parent table of the foreign key. Similarly, the foreign key is the child
    constraint of its referenced primary key; the table of the foreign key is the child table of the primary
    key.
    
    You can declare primary keys and foreign keys as part of the table specification during table creation.
    You can also add or drop constraints on existing tables.

    .. py:method:: create(full_name_arg: str, constraint: TableConstraint) -> TableConstraint

        Create a table constraint.
        
        Creates a new table constraint.
        
        For the table constraint creation to succeed, the user must satisfy both of these conditions: - the
        user must have the **USE_CATALOG** privilege on the table's parent catalog, the **USE_SCHEMA**
        privilege on the table's parent schema, and be the owner of the table. - if the new constraint is a
        __ForeignKeyConstraint__, the user must have the **USE_CATALOG** privilege on the referenced parent
        table's catalog, the **USE_SCHEMA** privilege on the referenced parent table's schema, and be the
        owner of the referenced parent table.
        
        :param full_name_arg: str
          The full name of the table referenced by the constraint.
        :param constraint: :class:`TableConstraint`
          A table constraint, as defined by *one* of the following fields being set:
          __primary_key_constraint__, __foreign_key_constraint__, __named_table_constraint__.
        
        :returns: :class:`TableConstraint`
        

    .. py:method:: delete(full_name: str, constraint_name: str, cascade: bool)

        Delete a table constraint.
        
        Deletes a table constraint.
        
        For the table constraint deletion to succeed, the user must satisfy both of these conditions: - the
        user must have the **USE_CATALOG** privilege on the table's parent catalog, the **USE_SCHEMA**
        privilege on the table's parent schema, and be the owner of the table. - if __cascade__ argument is
        **true**, the user must have the following permissions on all of the child tables: the **USE_CATALOG**
        privilege on the table's catalog, the **USE_SCHEMA** privilege on the table's schema, and be the owner
        of the table.
        
        :param full_name: str
          Full name of the table referenced by the constraint.
        :param constraint_name: str
          The name of the constraint to delete.
        :param cascade: bool
          If true, try deleting all child constraints of the current constraint. If false, reject this
          operation if the current constraint has any child constraints.
