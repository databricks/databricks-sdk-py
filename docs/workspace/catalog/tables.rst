``w.tables``: Tables
====================
.. currentmodule:: databricks.sdk.service.catalog

.. py:class:: TablesAPI

    A table resides in the third layer of Unity Catalogâ€™s three-level namespace. It contains rows of data.
    To create a table, users must have CREATE_TABLE and USE_SCHEMA permissions on the schema, and they must
    have the USE_CATALOG permission on its parent catalog. To query a table, users must have the SELECT
    permission on the table, and they must have the USE_CATALOG permission on its parent catalog and the
    USE_SCHEMA permission on its parent schema.
    
    A table can be managed or external. From an API perspective, a __VIEW__ is a particular kind of table
    (rather than a managed or external table).

    .. py:method:: delete(full_name: str)

        Delete a table.
        
        Deletes a table from the specified parent catalog and schema. The caller must be the owner of the
        parent catalog, have the **USE_CATALOG** privilege on the parent catalog and be the owner of the
        parent schema, or be the owner of the table and have the **USE_CATALOG** privilege on the parent
        catalog and the **USE_SCHEMA** privilege on the parent schema.
        
        :param full_name: str
          Full name of the table.
        
        
        

    .. py:method:: exists(full_name: str) -> TableExistsResponse

        Get boolean reflecting if table exists.
        
        Gets if a table exists in the metastore for a specific catalog and schema. The caller must satisfy one
        of the following requirements: * Be a metastore admin * Be the owner of the parent catalog * Be the
        owner of the parent schema and have the USE_CATALOG privilege on the parent catalog * Have the
        **USE_CATALOG** privilege on the parent catalog and the **USE_SCHEMA** privilege on the parent schema,
        and either be the table owner or have the SELECT privilege on the table. * Have BROWSE privilege on
        the parent catalog * Have BROWSE privilege on the parent schema.
        
        :param full_name: str
          Full name of the table.
        
        :returns: :class:`TableExistsResponse`
