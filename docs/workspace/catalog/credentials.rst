``w.credentials``: Credentials
==============================
.. currentmodule:: databricks.sdk.service.catalog

.. py:class:: CredentialsAPI

    A credential represents an authentication and authorization mechanism for accessing services on your cloud
    tenant. Each credential is subject to Unity Catalog access-control policies that control which users and
    groups can access the credential.
    
    To create credentials, you must be a Databricks account admin or have the `CREATE SERVICE CREDENTIAL`
    privilege. The user who creates the credential can delegate ownership to another user or group to manage
    permissions on it.

    .. py:method:: create_credential(name: str [, aws_iam_role: Optional[AwsIamRole], azure_managed_identity: Optional[AzureManagedIdentity], azure_service_principal: Optional[AzureServicePrincipal], comment: Optional[str], databricks_gcp_service_account: Optional[DatabricksGcpServiceAccount], purpose: Optional[CredentialPurpose], read_only: Optional[bool], skip_validation: Optional[bool]]) -> CredentialInfo

        Create a credential.
        
        Creates a new credential. The type of credential to be created is determined by the **purpose** field,

        The caller must be a metastore admin or have the metastore privilege **CREATE_STORAGE_CREDENTIAL** for
        storage credentials, or **CREATE_SERVICE_CREDENTIAL** for service credentials.
        
        :param name: str
          The credential name. The name must be unique among storage and service credentials within the
          metastore.

          **STORAGE**.
        :param skip_validation: bool (optional)
          Optional. Supplying true to this argument skips validation of the created set of credentials.

    .. py:method:: generate_temporary_service_credential(credential_name: str [, azure_options: Optional[GenerateTemporaryServiceCredentialAzureOptions], gcp_options: Optional[GenerateTemporaryServiceCredentialGcpOptions]]) -> TemporaryCredentials

        The array is limited to only the credentials that the caller has permission to access. If the caller
        is a metastore admin, retrieval of credentials is unrestricted. There is no guarantee of a specific
        ordering of the elements in the array.
        
        :param max_results: int (optional)
          Maximum number of credentials to return. - If not set, the default max page size is used. - When set
          to a value greater than 0, the page length is the minimum of this value and a server-configured
          value. - When set to 0, the page length is set to a server-configured value (recommended). - When
          set to a value less than 0, an invalid parameter error is returned.

        For storage credentials (purpose is **STORAGE**), at least one of __external_location_name__ and
        __url__ need to be provided. If only one of them is provided, it will be used for validation. And if
        both are provided, the __url__ will be used for validation, and __external_location_name__ will be
        ignored when checking overlapping urls. Either the __credential_name__ or the cloud-specific
        credential must be provided.
