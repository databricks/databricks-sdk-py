``w.quality_monitors``: Quality Monitors
========================================
.. currentmodule:: databricks.sdk.service.catalog

.. py:class:: QualityMonitorsAPI

    A monitor computes and monitors data or model quality metrics for a table over time. It generates metrics
    tables and a dashboard that you can use to monitor table health and set alerts.
    
    Most write operations require the user to be the owner of the table (or its parent schema or parent
    catalog). Viewing the dashboard, computed metrics, or monitor configuration only requires the user to have
    **SELECT** privileges on the table (along with **USE_SCHEMA** and **USE_CATALOG**).

    .. py:method:: cancel_refresh(table_name: str, refresh_id: str)

        Cancel refresh.

        The caller must either: 1. be an owner of the table's parent catalog 2. have **USE_CATALOG** on the
        table's parent catalog and be an owner of the table's parent schema 3. have the following permissions:
        - **USE_CATALOG** on the table's parent catalog - **USE_SCHEMA** on the table's parent schema - be an
        owner of the table
        
        Additionally, the call must be made from the workspace where the monitor was created.
