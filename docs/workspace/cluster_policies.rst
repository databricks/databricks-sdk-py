Cluster Policies
================
.. py:class:: ClusterPoliciesAPI

    Cluster policy limits the ability to configure clusters based on a set of rules. The policy rules limit
    the attributes or attribute values available for cluster creation. Cluster policies have ACLs that limit
    their use to specific users and groups.
    
    Cluster policies let you limit users to create clusters with prescribed settings, simplify the user
    interface and enable more users to create their own clusters (by fixing and hiding some values), control
    cost by limiting per cluster maximum cost (by setting limits on attributes whose values contribute to
    hourly price).
    
    Cluster policy permissions limit which policies a user can select in the Policy drop-down when the user
    creates a cluster: - A user who has cluster create permission can select the Unrestricted policy and
    create fully-configurable clusters. - A user who has both cluster create permission and access to cluster
    policies can select the Unrestricted policy and policies they have access to. - A user that has access to
    only cluster policies, can select the policies they have access to.
    
    If no policies have been created in the workspace, the Policy drop-down does not display.
    
    Only admin users can create, edit, and delete policies. Admin users also have access to all policies.

        Creates a new policy with prescribed settings.
        
        :param name: str
          Cluster Policy name requested by the user. This has to be unique. Length must be between 1 and 100
          characters.
        :param definition: str (optional)
          Policy definition document expressed in Databricks Cluster Policy Definition Language.

        :param max_clusters_per_user: int (optional)
          Max number of clusters per user that can be active using this policy. If not present, there is no
          max limit.

          Policy definition JSON document expressed in Databricks Policy Definition Language. The JSON
          document must be passed as a string and cannot be embedded in the requests.
          
          You can use this to customize the policy definition inherited from the policy family. Policy rules
          specified here are merged into the inherited policy definition.

          ID of the policy family. The cluster policy's policy definition inherits the policy family's policy
          definition.
