Connections
===========
.. py:class:: ConnectionsAPI

    Connections allow for creating a connection to an external data source.
    
    A connection is an abstraction of an external data source that can be connected from Databricks Compute.
    Creating a connection object is the first step to managing external data sources within Unity Catalog,
    with the second step being creating a data object (catalog, schema, or table) using the connection. Data
    objects derived from a connection can be written to or read from similar to other Unity Catalog data
    objects based on cloud storage. Users may create different types of connections with each connection
    having a unique set of configuration options to support credential management and other settings.
