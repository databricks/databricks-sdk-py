External Locations
==================
.. py:class:: ExternalLocationsAPI

    An external location is an object that combines a cloud storage path with a storage credential that
    authorizes access to the cloud storage path. Each external location is subject to Unity Catalog
    access-control policies that control which users and groups can access the credential. If a user does not
    have access to an external location in Unity Catalog, the request fails and Unity Catalog does not attempt
    to authenticate to your cloud tenant on the userâ€™s behalf.
    
    Databricks recommends using external locations rather than using storage credentials directly.
    
    To create external locations, you must be a metastore admin or a user with the
    **CREATE_EXTERNAL_LOCATION** privilege.
