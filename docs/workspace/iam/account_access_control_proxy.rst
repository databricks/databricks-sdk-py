``w.account_access_control_proxy``: Account Access Control Proxy
================================================================
.. currentmodule:: databricks.sdk.service.iam

.. py:class:: AccountAccessControlProxyAPI

    These APIs manage access rules on resources in an account. Currently, only grant rules are supported. A
    grant rule specifies a role assigned to a set of principals. A list of rules attached to a resource is
    called a rule set. A workspace must belong to an account for these APIs to work.

    .. py:method:: get_assignable_roles_for_resource(resource: str) -> GetAssignableRolesForResourceResponse

        Get assignable roles for a resource.
        
        Gets all the roles that can be granted on an account-level resource. A role is grantable if the rule
        set on the resource can contain an access rule of the role.
        
        :param resource: str
          The resource name for which assignable roles will be listed.
        
        :returns: :class:`GetAssignableRolesForResourceResponse`
        

    .. py:method:: get_rule_set(name: str, etag: str) -> RuleSetResponse

        Get a rule set.
        
        Get a rule set by its name. A rule set is always attached to a resource and contains a list of access
        rules on the said resource. Currently only a default rule set for each resource is supported.
        
        :param name: str
          The ruleset name associated with the request.
        :param etag: str
          Etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag provided. Etag is used for
          optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a rule set from
          overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read ->
          modify -> write pattern to perform rule set updates in order to avoid race conditions that is get an
          etag from a GET rule set request, and pass it with the PUT update request to identify the rule set
          version you are updating.
        
        :returns: :class:`RuleSetResponse`
        

    .. py:method:: update_rule_set(name: str, rule_set: RuleSetUpdateRequest) -> RuleSetResponse

        Update a rule set.
        
        Replace the rules of a rule set. First, use a GET rule set request to read the current version of the
        rule set before modifying it. This pattern helps prevent conflicts between concurrent updates.
        
        :param name: str
          Name of the rule set.
        :param rule_set: :class:`RuleSetUpdateRequest`
        
        :returns: :class:`RuleSetResponse`
