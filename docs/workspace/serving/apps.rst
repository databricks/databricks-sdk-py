``w.apps``: Apps
================
.. currentmodule:: databricks.sdk.service.serving

.. py:class:: AppsAPI

    Apps run directly on a customerâ€™s Databricks instance, integrate with their data, use and extend
    Databricks services, and enable users to interact through single sign-on.

    .. py:method:: create(name: str [, description: Optional[str]]) -> Wait[App]

        Create an app.
        
        Creates a new app.
        
        :param name: str
          The name of the app. The name must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens. It
          must be unique within the workspace.
        :param description: str (optional)
          The description of the app.
        
        :returns:
          Long-running operation waiter for :class:`App`.
          See :method:wait_get_app_idle for more details.
        

    .. py:method:: create_and_wait(name: str [, description: Optional[str], timeout: datetime.timedelta = 0:20:00]) -> App


    .. py:method:: delete(name: str)

        Delete an app.
        
        Deletes an app.
        
        :param name: str
          The name of the app.
        
        
        

    .. py:method:: deploy(app_name: str, source_code_path: str, mode: AppDeploymentMode) -> Wait[AppDeployment]

        Create an app deployment.
        
        Creates an app deployment for the app with the supplied name.
        
        :param app_name: str
          The name of the app.
        :param source_code_path: str
          The workspace file system path of the source code used to create the app deployment. This is
          different from `deployment_artifacts.source_code_path`, which is the path used by the deployed app.
          The former refers to the original source code location of the app in the workspace during deployment
          creation, whereas the latter provides a system generated stable snapshotted source code path used by
          the deployment.
        :param mode: :class:`AppDeploymentMode`
          The mode of which the deployment will manage the source code.
        
        :returns:
          Long-running operation waiter for :class:`AppDeployment`.
          See :method:wait_get_deployment_app_succeeded for more details.
