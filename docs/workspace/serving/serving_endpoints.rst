.. py:class:: ServingEndpointsAPI

    The Serving Endpoints API allows you to create, update, and delete model serving endpoints.
    
    You can use a serving endpoint to serve models from the Databricks Model Registry or from Unity Catalog.
    Endpoints expose the underlying models as scalable REST API endpoints using serverless compute. This means
    the endpoints and associated compute resources are fully managed by Databricks and will not appear in your
    cloud account. A serving endpoint can consist of one or more MLflow models from the Databricks Model
    Registry, called served entities. A serving endpoint can have at most ten served entities. You can
    configure traffic settings to define how requests should be routed to your served entities behind an
    endpoint. Additionally, you can configure the scale of resources that should be applied to each served
    entity.
